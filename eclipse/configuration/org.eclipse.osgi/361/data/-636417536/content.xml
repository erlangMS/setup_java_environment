Application of Additional Terms.  You may not offer or impose any&#xA;terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form that alters or&#xA;restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients&#xA;rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,&#xA;warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more&#xA;recipients of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your&#xA;own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any&#xA;Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty,&#xA;support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone,&#xA;and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every&#xA;Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or&#xA;such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or&#xA;liability terms You offer.&#xA;&#xA;3.5.

You may distribute the&#xA;Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms of this&#xA;License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may&#xA;contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in&#xA;compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the&#xA;Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients&#xA;rights in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this&#xA;License. If You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form&#xA;under a different license, You must make it absolutely clear that any&#xA;terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by&#xA;the Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify&#xA;the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred&#xA;by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such&#xA;terms You offer.&#xA;&#xA;3.6.

Each version will be given a distinguishing version&#xA;number. Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than the&#xA;license steward has the right to modify this License.&#xA;&#xA;4.2. Effect of New Versions.&#xA;&#xA;You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the&#xA;Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the&#xA;License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If&#xA;the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software&#xA;prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available&#xA;under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and&#xA;make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of&#xA;the License under which You originally received the Covered&#xA;Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or&#xA;otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any&#xA;subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.&#xA;4.3. Modified Versions.&#xA;&#xA;When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license&#xA;for Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version&#xA;of this License if You: (a)Ã¡rename the license and remove any&#xA;references to the name of the license steward (except to note that the&#xA;license differs from this License); and (b)Ã¡otherwise make it clear&#xA;that the license contains terms which differ from this License.&#xA;&#xA;5.

Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect&#xA;beyond the termination of this License shall survive.&#xA;&#xA;6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory&#xA;judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the&#xA;Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such&#xA;claim is referred to as Participant) alleging that the&#xA;Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the&#xA;Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the&#xA;Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly&#xA;infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or&#xA;indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if&#xA;the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all&#xA;Contributors under SectionsÃ¡2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall,&#xA;upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and&#xA;automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice period,&#xA;unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with&#xA;respect to the Participant Software against such Participant&#xA;either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with&#xA;Participant.&#xA;&#xA;6.3. In the event of termination under SectionsÃ¡6.1 or 6.2 above, all&#xA;end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any&#xA;distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses&#xA;granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.&#xA;&#xA;7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.&#xA;&#xA;UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT&#xA;(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL&#xA;DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED&#xA;SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY&#xA;PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES&#xA;OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST&#xA;PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR&#xA;MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN&#xA;IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH&#xA;DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR&#xA;DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTYS NEGLIGENCE TO THE&#xA;EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO&#xA;NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL&#xA;DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.&#xA;&#xA;8.

MISCELLANEOUS.&#xA;&#xA;This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject&#xA;matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be&#xA;unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent&#xA;necessary to make it enforceable.

RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.&#xA;&#xA;As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is&#xA;responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,&#xA;out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to&#xA;work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such&#xA;responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or&#xA;shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.&#xA;&#xA;NOTICE PURSUANT TO SECTION 9 OF THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND&#xA;DISTRIBUTION LICENSE (CDDL) The GlassFish code released under the CDDL&#xA;shall be governed by the laws of the State of California (excluding&#xA;conflict-of-law provisions). Any litigation relating to this License&#xA;shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the&#xA;Northern District of California and the state courts of the State of&#xA;California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California.&#xA;&#xA;For plexus-archiver-1.0-alpha-7.jar:&#xA;&#xA;=========================================================================&#xA;==  Plexus License                                                     ==&#xA;=========================================================================&#xA;&#xA;Common Public License - v 1.0 &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON &#xA;PUBLIC LICENSE (&quot;AGREEMENT&quot;). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE &#xA;PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT&apos;S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;1. DEFINITIONS &#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contribution&quot; means: &#xA;&#xA;a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and &#xA;documentation distributed under this Agreement, and&#xA;&#xA;b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:&#xA;&#xA;i) changes to the Program, and&#xA;&#xA;ii) additions to the Program;&#xA;&#xA;where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are &#xA;distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution &apos;originates&apos; &#xA;from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor &#xA;itself or anyone acting on such Contributor&apos;s behalf. Contributions do not &#xA;include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of &#xA;software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own &#xA;license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program. &#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contributor&quot; means any person or entity that distributes the Program. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Licensed Patents &quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which &#xA;are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or &#xA;when combined with the Program. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Program&quot; means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this &#xA;Agreement. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, &#xA;including all Contributors. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;2. GRANT OF RIGHTS &#xA;&#xA;a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants &#xA;Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to &#xA;reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly &#xA;perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, &#xA;if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.&#xA;&#xA;b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants &#xA;Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under &#xA;Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise &#xA;transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and &#xA;object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the &#xA;Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by &#xA;the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination &#xA;to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply &#xA;to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se &#xA;is licensed hereunder. &#xA;&#xA;c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses &#xA;to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any &#xA;Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other &#xA;intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims &#xA;any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on &#xA;infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to &#xA;exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby &#xA;assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights &#xA;needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to &#xA;allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient&apos;s responsibility &#xA;to acquire that license before distributing the Program.&#xA;&#xA;d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient &#xA;copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license &#xA;set forth in this Agreement.&#xA;&#xA;3. REQUIREMENTS &#xA;&#xA;A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under &#xA;its own license agreement, provided that: &#xA;&#xA;a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and&#xA;&#xA;b) its license agreement:&#xA;&#xA;i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and &#xA;conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title &#xA;and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability &#xA;and fitness for a particular purpose; &#xA;&#xA;ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for &#xA;damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential &#xA;damages, such as lost profits; &#xA;&#xA;iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered &#xA;by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and&#xA;&#xA;iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such &#xA;Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on &#xA;or through a medium customarily used for software exchange. &#xA;&#xA;When the Program is made available in source code form: &#xA;&#xA;a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and &#xA;&#xA;b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program. &#xA;&#xA;Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within &#xA;the Program. &#xA;&#xA;Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its &#xA;Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent &#xA;Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution. &#xA;&#xA;4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION &#xA;&#xA;Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities &#xA;with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this &#xA;license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the &#xA;Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering &#xA;should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for &#xA;other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a &#xA;commercial product offering, such Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;) &#xA;hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (&quot;Indemnified &#xA;Contributor&quot;) against any losses, damages and costs (collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) &#xA;arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third &#xA;party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts &#xA;or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its &#xA;distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The &#xA;obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating &#xA;to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to &#xA;qualify, &#xA;an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial &#xA;Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial &#xA;Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, &#xA;the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified &#xA;Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial &#xA;product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial &#xA;Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, &#xA;or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and &#xA;warranties are such Commercial Contributor&apos;s responsibility alone. Under &#xA;this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims &#xA;against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and &#xA;warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any &#xA;damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;5. NO WARRANTY &#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED &#xA;ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER &#xA;EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR &#xA;CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A &#xA;PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining &#xA;the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all &#xA;risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, &#xA;including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, &#xA;compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or &#xA;equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY &#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY &#xA;CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, &#xA;SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION &#xA;LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN &#xA;CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) &#xA;ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE &#xA;EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE &#xA;POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;7. GENERAL &#xA;&#xA;If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under &#xA;applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of &#xA;the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action &#xA;by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum &#xA;extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with &#xA;respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or &#xA;counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that &#xA;Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as &#xA;of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient &#xA;institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim &#xA;or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding &#xA;combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes &#xA;such Recipient&apos;s patent(s), then such Recipient&apos;s rights granted under &#xA;Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;All Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails &#xA;to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement &#xA;and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after &#xA;becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient&apos;s rights under this &#xA;Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the &#xA;Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient&apos;s obligations &#xA;under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the &#xA;Program shall continue and survive. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, &#xA;but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may &#xA;only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves &#xA;the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement &#xA;from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right &#xA;to modify this Agreement. IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may &#xA;assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable &#xA;separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a &#xA;distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may &#xA;always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which &#xA;it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is &#xA;published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its &#xA;Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in &#xA;Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to &#xA;the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether &#xA;expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program &#xA;not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the &#xA;intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this &#xA;Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year &#xA;after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury &#xA;trial in any resulting litigation. &#xA;&#xA;'/>

Distribution Obligations.&#xA;&#xA;3.1. Availability of Source Code.&#xA;&#xA;Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available&#xA;in Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form and&#xA;that Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms of this&#xA;License. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of&#xA;the Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or&#xA;otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any such&#xA;Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can obtain such&#xA;Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or&#xA;through a medium customarily used for software exchange.&#xA;&#xA;3.2. Modifications.&#xA;&#xA;The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are&#xA;governed by the terms of this License. You represent that You believe&#xA;Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You have&#xA;sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.&#xA;&#xA;3.3. Required Notices.  You must include a notice in each of Your&#xA;Modifications that identifies You as the Contributor of the&#xA;Modification. You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or&#xA;trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, or any&#xA;notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving attribution to any&#xA;Contributor or the Initial Developer.&#xA;&#xA;3.4. Application of Additional Terms.  You may not offer or impose any&#xA;terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form that alters or&#xA;restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients&#xA;rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,&#xA;warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more&#xA;recipients of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your&#xA;own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any&#xA;Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty,&#xA;support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone,&#xA;and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every&#xA;Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or&#xA;such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or&#xA;liability terms You offer.&#xA;&#xA;3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.  You may distribute the&#xA;Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms of this&#xA;License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may&#xA;contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in&#xA;compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the&#xA;Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients&#xA;rights in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this&#xA;License. If You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form&#xA;under a different license, You must make it absolutely clear that any&#xA;terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by&#xA;the Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify&#xA;the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred&#xA;by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such&#xA;terms You offer.&#xA;&#xA;3.6. Larger Works.  You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered&#xA;Software with other code not governed by the terms of this License and&#xA;distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You&#xA;must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the&#xA;Covered Software.&#xA;&#xA;4. Versions of the License.&#xA;&#xA;4.1. New Versions.  Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license&#xA;steward and may publish revised and/or new versions of this License&#xA;from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version&#xA;number. Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than the&#xA;license steward has the right to modify this License.&#xA;&#xA;4.2. Effect of New Versions.&#xA;&#xA;You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the&#xA;Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the&#xA;License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If&#xA;the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software&#xA;prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available&#xA;under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and&#xA;make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of&#xA;the License under which You originally received the Covered&#xA;Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or&#xA;otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any&#xA;subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.&#xA;4.3. Modified Versions.&#xA;&#xA;When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license&#xA;for Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version&#xA;of this License if You: (a)Ã¡rename the license and remove any&#xA;references to the name of the license steward (except to note that the&#xA;license differs from this License); and (b)Ã¡otherwise make it clear&#xA;that the license contains terms which differ from this License.&#xA;&#xA;5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.&#xA;&#xA;COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN AS IS BASIS,&#xA;WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,&#xA;WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF&#xA;DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR&#xA;NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF&#xA;THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE&#xA;DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER&#xA;CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR&#xA;CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART&#xA;OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED&#xA;HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.&#xA;&#xA;6. TERMINATION.&#xA;&#xA;6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate&#xA;automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to&#xA;cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the&#xA;breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect&#xA;beyond the termination of this License shall survive.&#xA;&#xA;6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory&#xA;judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the&#xA;Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such&#xA;claim is referred to as Participant) alleging that the&#xA;Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the&#xA;Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the&#xA;Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly&#xA;infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or&#xA;indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if&#xA;the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all&#xA;Contributors under SectionsÃ¡2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall,&#xA;upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and&#xA;automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice period,&#xA;unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with&#xA;respect to the Participant Software against such Participant&#xA;either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with&#xA;Participant.&#xA;&#xA;6.3. In the event of termination under SectionsÃ¡6.1 or 6.2 above, all&#xA;end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any&#xA;distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses&#xA;granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.&#xA;&#xA;7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.&#xA;&#xA;UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT&#xA;(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL&#xA;DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED&#xA;SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY&#xA;PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES&#xA;OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST&#xA;PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR&#xA;MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN&#xA;IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH&#xA;DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR&#xA;DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTYS NEGLIGENCE TO THE&#xA;EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO&#xA;NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL&#xA;DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.&#xA;&#xA;8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.&#xA;&#xA;The Covered Software is a commercial item, as that term is defined in&#xA;48Ã¡C.F.R.Ã¡2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of commercial computer&#xA;software (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. Ã¡252.227-7014(a)(1))&#xA;and commercial computer software documentation as such terms are used&#xA;in 48Ã¡C.F.R.Ã¡12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and&#xA;48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all&#xA;U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only those&#xA;rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu&#xA;of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision&#xA;that addresses Government rights in computer software under this&#xA;License.&#xA;&#xA;9. MISCELLANEOUS.&#xA;&#xA;This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject&#xA;matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be&#xA;unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent&#xA;necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by&#xA;the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within the&#xA;Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any,&#xA;provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdictions conflict-of-law&#xA;provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject&#xA;to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and&#xA;venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software,&#xA;with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without&#xA;limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and&#xA;expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on&#xA;Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly&#xA;excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a&#xA;contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to&#xA;this License. You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance&#xA;with the United States export administration regulations (and the&#xA;export control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You&#xA;use, distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.&#xA;&#xA;10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.&#xA;&#xA;As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is&#xA;responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,&#xA;out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to&#xA;work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such&#xA;responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or&#xA;shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.&#xA;&#xA;NOTICE PURSUANT TO SECTION 9 OF THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND&#xA;DISTRIBUTION LICENSE (CDDL) The GlassFish code released under the CDDL&#xA;shall be governed by the laws of the State of California (excluding&#xA;conflict-of-law provisions). Any litigation relating to this License&#xA;shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the&#xA;Northern District of California and the state courts of the State of&#xA;California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California.&#xA;&#xA;For plexus-archiver jar:&#xA;&#xA;=========================================================================&#xA;==  Plexus License                                                     ==&#xA;=========================================================================&#xA;&#xA;Common Public License - v 1.0 &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON &#xA;PUBLIC LICENSE (&quot;AGREEMENT&quot;). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE &#xA;PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT&apos;S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;1. DEFINITIONS &#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contribution&quot; means: &#xA;&#xA;a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and &#xA;documentation distributed under this Agreement, and&#xA;&#xA;b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:&#xA;&#xA;i) changes to the Program, and&#xA;&#xA;ii) additions to the Program;&#xA;&#xA;where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are &#xA;distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution &apos;originates&apos; &#xA;from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor &#xA;itself or anyone acting on such Contributor&apos;s behalf. Contributions do not &#xA;include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of &#xA;software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own &#xA;license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program. &#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contributor&quot; means any person or entity that distributes the Program. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Licensed Patents &quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which &#xA;are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or &#xA;when combined with the Program. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Program&quot; means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this &#xA;Agreement. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, &#xA;including all Contributors. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;2. GRANT OF RIGHTS &#xA;&#xA;a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants &#xA;Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to &#xA;reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly &#xA;perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, &#xA;if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.&#xA;&#xA;b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants &#xA;Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under &#xA;Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise &#xA;transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and &#xA;object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the &#xA;Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by &#xA;the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination &#xA;to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply &#xA;to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se &#xA;is licensed hereunder. &#xA;&#xA;c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses &#xA;to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any &#xA;Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other &#xA;intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims &#xA;any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on &#xA;infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to &#xA;exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby &#xA;assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights &#xA;needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to &#xA;allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient&apos;s responsibility &#xA;to acquire that license before distributing the Program.&#xA;&#xA;d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient &#xA;copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license &#xA;set forth in this Agreement.&#xA;&#xA;3. REQUIREMENTS &#xA;&#xA;A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under &#xA;its own license agreement, provided that: &#xA;&#xA;a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and&#xA;&#xA;b) its license agreement:&#xA;&#xA;i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and &#xA;conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title &#xA;and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability &#xA;and fitness for a particular purpose; &#xA;&#xA;ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for &#xA;damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential &#xA;damages, such as lost profits; &#xA;&#xA;iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered &#xA;by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and&#xA;&#xA;iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such &#xA;Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on &#xA;or through a medium customarily used for software exchange. &#xA;&#xA;When the Program is made available in source code form: &#xA;&#xA;a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and &#xA;&#xA;b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program. &#xA;&#xA;Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within &#xA;the Program. &#xA;&#xA;Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its &#xA;Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent &#xA;Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution. &#xA;&#xA;4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION &#xA;&#xA;Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities &#xA;with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this &#xA;license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the &#xA;Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering &#xA;should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for &#xA;other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a &#xA;commercial product offering, such Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;) &#xA;hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (&quot;Indemnified &#xA;Contributor&quot;) against any losses, damages and costs (collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) &#xA;arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third &#xA;party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts &#xA;or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its &#xA;distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The &#xA;obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating &#xA;to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to &#xA;qualify, &#xA;an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial &#xA;Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial &#xA;Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, &#xA;the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified &#xA;Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial &#xA;product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial &#xA;Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, &#xA;or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and &#xA;warranties are such Commercial Contributor&apos;s responsibility alone. Under &#xA;this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims &#xA;against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and &#xA;warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any &#xA;damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;5. NO WARRANTY &#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED &#xA;ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER &#xA;EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR &#xA;CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A &#xA;PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining &#xA;the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all &#xA;risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, &#xA;including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, &#xA;compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or &#xA;equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY &#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY &#xA;CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, &#xA;SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION &#xA;LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN &#xA;CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) &#xA;ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE &#xA;EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE &#xA;POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;7. GENERAL &#xA;&#xA;If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under &#xA;applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of &#xA;the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action &#xA;by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum &#xA;extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with &#xA;respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or &#xA;counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that &#xA;Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as &#xA;of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient &#xA;institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim &#xA;or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding &#xA;combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes &#xA;such Recipient&apos;s patent(s), then such Recipient&apos;s rights granted under &#xA;Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;All Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails &#xA;to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement &#xA;and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after &#xA;becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient&apos;s rights under this &#xA;Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the &#xA;Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient&apos;s obligations &#xA;under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the &#xA;Program shall continue and survive. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, &#xA;but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may &#xA;only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves &#xA;the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement &#xA;from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right &#xA;to modify this Agreement. IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may &#xA;assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable &#xA;separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a &#xA;distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may &#xA;always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which &#xA;it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is &#xA;published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its &#xA;Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in &#xA;Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to &#xA;the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether &#xA;expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program &#xA;not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the &#xA;intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this &#xA;Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year &#xA;after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury &#xA;trial in any resulting litigation. &#xA;&#xA;'/>

You are solely responsible for determining the&#xA;appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any&#xA;risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.&#xA;&#xA;8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,&#xA;whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,&#xA;unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly&#xA;negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be&#xA;liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,&#xA;incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a&#xA;result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the&#xA;Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,&#xA;work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all&#xA;other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor&#xA;has been advised of the possibility of such damages.&#xA;&#xA;9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing&#xA;the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,&#xA;and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,&#xA;or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this&#xA;License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only&#xA;on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf&#xA;of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,&#xA;defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability&#xA;incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason&#xA;of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.&#xA;&#xA;END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;&#xA;APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.&#xA;&#xA;To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following&#xA;boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets &quot;[]&quot;&#xA;replaced with your own identifying information.

Distribution Obligations.&#xA;&#xA;3.1. Availability of Source Code.&#xA;&#xA;Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available&#xA;in Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form and&#xA;that Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms of this&#xA;License. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of&#xA;the Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or&#xA;otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any such&#xA;Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can obtain such&#xA;Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or&#xA;through a medium customarily used for software exchange.&#xA;&#xA;3.2. Modifications.&#xA;&#xA;The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are&#xA;governed by the terms of this License. You represent that You believe&#xA;Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You have&#xA;sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.&#xA;&#xA;3.3. Required Notices.  You must include a notice in each of Your&#xA;Modifications that identifies You as the Contributor of the&#xA;Modification. You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or&#xA;trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, or any&#xA;notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving attribution to any&#xA;Contributor or the Initial Developer.&#xA;&#xA;3.4. Application of Additional Terms.  You may not offer or impose any&#xA;terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form that alters or&#xA;restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients&#xA;rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,&#xA;warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more&#xA;recipients of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your&#xA;own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any&#xA;Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty,&#xA;support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone,&#xA;and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every&#xA;Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or&#xA;such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or&#xA;liability terms You offer.&#xA;&#xA;3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.  You may distribute the&#xA;Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms of this&#xA;License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may&#xA;contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in&#xA;compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the&#xA;Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients&#xA;rights in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this&#xA;License. If You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form&#xA;under a different license, You must make it absolutely clear that any&#xA;terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by&#xA;the Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify&#xA;the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred&#xA;by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such&#xA;terms You offer.&#xA;&#xA;3.6. Larger Works.  You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered&#xA;Software with other code not governed by the terms of this License and&#xA;distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You&#xA;must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the&#xA;Covered Software.&#xA;&#xA;4. Versions of the License.&#xA;&#xA;4.1. New Versions.  Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license&#xA;steward and may publish revised and/or new versions of this License&#xA;from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version&#xA;number. Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than the&#xA;license steward has the right to modify this License.&#xA;&#xA;4.2. Effect of New Versions.&#xA;&#xA;You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the&#xA;Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the&#xA;License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If&#xA;the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software&#xA;prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available&#xA;under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and&#xA;make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of&#xA;the License under which You originally received the Covered&#xA;Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or&#xA;otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any&#xA;subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.&#xA;4.3. Modified Versions.&#xA;&#xA;When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license&#xA;for Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version&#xA;of this License if You: (a)Ã¡rename the license and remove any&#xA;references to the name of the license steward (except to note that the&#xA;license differs from this License); and (b)Ã¡otherwise make it clear&#xA;that the license contains terms which differ from this License.&#xA;&#xA;5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.&#xA;&#xA;COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN AS IS BASIS,&#xA;WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,&#xA;WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF&#xA;DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR&#xA;NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF&#xA;THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE&#xA;DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER&#xA;CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR&#xA;CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART&#xA;OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED&#xA;HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.&#xA;&#xA;6. TERMINATION.&#xA;&#xA;6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate&#xA;automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to&#xA;cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the&#xA;breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect&#xA;beyond the termination of this License shall survive.&#xA;&#xA;6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory&#xA;judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the&#xA;Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such&#xA;claim is referred to as Participant) alleging that the&#xA;Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the&#xA;Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the&#xA;Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly&#xA;infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or&#xA;indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if&#xA;the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all&#xA;Contributors under SectionsÃ¡2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall,&#xA;upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and&#xA;automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice period,&#xA;unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with&#xA;respect to the Participant Software against such Participant&#xA;either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with&#xA;Participant.&#xA;&#xA;6.3. In the event of termination under SectionsÃ¡6.1 or 6.2 above, all&#xA;end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any&#xA;distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses&#xA;granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.&#xA;&#xA;7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.&#xA;&#xA;UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT&#xA;(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL&#xA;DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED&#xA;SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY&#xA;PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES&#xA;OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST&#xA;PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR&#xA;MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN&#xA;IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH&#xA;DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR&#xA;DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTYS NEGLIGENCE TO THE&#xA;EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO&#xA;NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL&#xA;DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.&#xA;&#xA;8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.&#xA;&#xA;The Covered Software is a commercial item, as that term is defined in&#xA;48Ã¡C.F.R.Ã¡2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of commercial computer&#xA;software (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. Ã¡252.227-7014(a)(1))&#xA;and commercial computer software documentation as such terms are used&#xA;in 48Ã¡C.F.R.Ã¡12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and&#xA;48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all&#xA;U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only those&#xA;rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu&#xA;of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision&#xA;that addresses Government rights in computer software under this&#xA;License.&#xA;&#xA;9. MISCELLANEOUS.&#xA;&#xA;This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject&#xA;matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be&#xA;unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent&#xA;necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by&#xA;the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within the&#xA;Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any,&#xA;provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdictions conflict-of-law&#xA;provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject&#xA;to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and&#xA;venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software,&#xA;with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without&#xA;limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and&#xA;expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on&#xA;Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly&#xA;excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a&#xA;contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to&#xA;this License. You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance&#xA;with the United States export administration regulations (and the&#xA;export control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You&#xA;use, distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.&#xA;&#xA;10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.&#xA;&#xA;As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is&#xA;responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,&#xA;out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to&#xA;work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such&#xA;responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or&#xA;shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.&#xA;&#xA;NOTICE PURSUANT TO SECTION 9 OF THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND&#xA;DISTRIBUTION LICENSE (CDDL) The GlassFish code released under the CDDL&#xA;shall be governed by the laws of the State of California (excluding&#xA;conflict-of-law provisions). Any litigation relating to this License&#xA;shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the&#xA;Northern District of California and the state courts of the State of&#xA;California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California.&#xA;&#xA;For plexus-archiver-1.0-alpha-7.jar:&#xA;&#xA;=========================================================================&#xA;==  Plexus License                                                     ==&#xA;=========================================================================&#xA;&#xA;Common Public License - v 1.0 &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON &#xA;PUBLIC LICENSE (&quot;AGREEMENT&quot;). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE &#xA;PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT&apos;S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;1. DEFINITIONS &#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contribution&quot; means: &#xA;&#xA;a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and &#xA;documentation distributed under this Agreement, and&#xA;&#xA;b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:&#xA;&#xA;i) changes to the Program, and&#xA;&#xA;ii) additions to the Program;&#xA;&#xA;where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are &#xA;distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution &apos;originates&apos; &#xA;from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor &#xA;itself or anyone acting on such Contributor&apos;s behalf. Contributions do not &#xA;include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of &#xA;software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own &#xA;license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program. &#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contributor&quot; means any person or entity that distributes the Program. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Licensed Patents &quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which &#xA;are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or &#xA;when combined with the Program. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Program&quot; means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this &#xA;Agreement. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, &#xA;including all Contributors. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;2. GRANT OF RIGHTS &#xA;&#xA;a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants &#xA;Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to &#xA;reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly &#xA;perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, &#xA;if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.&#xA;&#xA;b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants &#xA;Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under &#xA;Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise &#xA;transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and &#xA;object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the &#xA;Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by &#xA;the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination &#xA;to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply &#xA;to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se &#xA;is licensed hereunder. &#xA;&#xA;c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses &#xA;to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any &#xA;Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other &#xA;intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims &#xA;any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on &#xA;infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to &#xA;exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby &#xA;assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights &#xA;needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to &#xA;allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient&apos;s responsibility &#xA;to acquire that license before distributing the Program.&#xA;&#xA;d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient &#xA;copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license &#xA;set forth in this Agreement.&#xA;&#xA;3. REQUIREMENTS &#xA;&#xA;A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under &#xA;its own license agreement, provided that: &#xA;&#xA;a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and&#xA;&#xA;b) its license agreement:&#xA;&#xA;i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and &#xA;conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title &#xA;and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability &#xA;and fitness for a particular purpose; &#xA;&#xA;ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for &#xA;damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential &#xA;damages, such as lost profits; &#xA;&#xA;iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered &#xA;by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and&#xA;&#xA;iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such &#xA;Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on &#xA;or through a medium customarily used for software exchange. &#xA;&#xA;When the Program is made available in source code form: &#xA;&#xA;a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and &#xA;&#xA;b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program. &#xA;&#xA;Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within &#xA;the Program. &#xA;&#xA;Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its &#xA;Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent &#xA;Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution. &#xA;&#xA;4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION &#xA;&#xA;Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities &#xA;with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this &#xA;license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the &#xA;Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering &#xA;should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for &#xA;other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a &#xA;commercial product offering, such Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;) &#xA;hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (&quot;Indemnified &#xA;Contributor&quot;) against any losses, damages and costs (collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) &#xA;arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third &#xA;party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts &#xA;or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its &#xA;distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The &#xA;obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating &#xA;to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to &#xA;qualify, &#xA;an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial &#xA;Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial &#xA;Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, &#xA;the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified &#xA;Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial &#xA;product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial &#xA;Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, &#xA;or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and &#xA;warranties are such Commercial Contributor&apos;s responsibility alone. Under &#xA;this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims &#xA;against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and &#xA;warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any &#xA;damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;5. NO WARRANTY &#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED &#xA;ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER &#xA;EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR &#xA;CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A &#xA;PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining &#xA;the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all &#xA;risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, &#xA;including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, &#xA;compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or &#xA;equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY &#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY &#xA;CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, &#xA;SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION &#xA;LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN &#xA;CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) &#xA;ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE &#xA;EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE &#xA;POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;7. GENERAL &#xA;&#xA;If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under &#xA;applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of &#xA;the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action &#xA;by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum &#xA;extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with &#xA;respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or &#xA;counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that &#xA;Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as &#xA;of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient &#xA;institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim &#xA;or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding &#xA;combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes &#xA;such Recipient&apos;s patent(s), then such Recipient&apos;s rights granted under &#xA;Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;All Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails &#xA;to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement &#xA;and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after &#xA;becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient&apos;s rights under this &#xA;Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the &#xA;Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient&apos;s obligations &#xA;under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the &#xA;Program shall continue and survive. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, &#xA;but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may &#xA;only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves &#xA;the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement &#xA;from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right &#xA;to modify this Agreement. IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may &#xA;assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable &#xA;separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a &#xA;distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may &#xA;always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which &#xA;it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is &#xA;published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its &#xA;Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in &#xA;Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to &#xA;the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether &#xA;expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program &#xA;not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the &#xA;intellectual property laws of the United States of America.

Availability of Source Code.&#xA;&#xA;Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available&#xA;in Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form and&#xA;that Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms of this&#xA;License. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of&#xA;the Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or&#xA;otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any such&#xA;Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can obtain such&#xA;Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or&#xA;through a medium customarily used for software exchange.&#xA;&#xA;3.2. Modifications.&#xA;&#xA;The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are&#xA;governed by the terms of this License. You represent that You believe&#xA;Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You have&#xA;sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.&#xA;&#xA;3.3. Required Notices.  You must include a notice in each of Your&#xA;Modifications that identifies You as the Contributor of the&#xA;Modification. You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or&#xA;trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, or any&#xA;notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving attribution to any&#xA;Contributor or the Initial Developer.&#xA;&#xA;3.4. Application of Additional Terms.  You may not offer or impose any&#xA;terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form that alters or&#xA;restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients&#xA;rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,&#xA;warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more&#xA;recipients of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your&#xA;own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any&#xA;Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty,&#xA;support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone,&#xA;and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every&#xA;Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or&#xA;such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or&#xA;liability terms You offer.&#xA;&#xA;3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.  You may distribute the&#xA;Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms of this&#xA;License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may&#xA;contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in&#xA;compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the&#xA;Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients&#xA;rights in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this&#xA;License. If You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form&#xA;under a different license, You must make it absolutely clear that any&#xA;terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by&#xA;the Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify&#xA;the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred&#xA;by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such&#xA;terms You offer.&#xA;&#xA;3.6. Larger Works.  You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered&#xA;Software with other code not governed by the terms of this License and&#xA;distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You&#xA;must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the&#xA;Covered Software.&#xA;&#xA;4. Versions of the License.&#xA;&#xA;4.1. New Versions.  Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license&#xA;steward and may publish revised and/or new versions of this License&#xA;from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version&#xA;number. Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than the&#xA;license steward has the right to modify this License.&#xA;&#xA;4.2. Effect of New Versions.&#xA;&#xA;You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the&#xA;Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the&#xA;License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If&#xA;the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software&#xA;prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available&#xA;under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and&#xA;make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of&#xA;the License under which You originally received the Covered&#xA;Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or&#xA;otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any&#xA;subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.&#xA;4.3. Modified Versions.&#xA;&#xA;When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license&#xA;for Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version&#xA;of this License if You: (a)Ã¡rename the license and remove any&#xA;references to the name of the license steward (except to note that the&#xA;license differs from this License); and (b)Ã¡otherwise make it clear&#xA;that the license contains terms which differ from this License.&#xA;&#xA;5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.&#xA;&#xA;COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN AS IS BASIS,&#xA;WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,&#xA;WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF&#xA;DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR&#xA;NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF&#xA;THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE&#xA;DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER&#xA;CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR&#xA;CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART&#xA;OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED&#xA;HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.&#xA;&#xA;6. TERMINATION.&#xA;&#xA;6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate&#xA;automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to&#xA;cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the&#xA;breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect&#xA;beyond the termination of this License shall survive.&#xA;&#xA;6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory&#xA;judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the&#xA;Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such&#xA;claim is referred to as Participant) alleging that the&#xA;Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the&#xA;Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the&#xA;Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly&#xA;infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or&#xA;indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if&#xA;the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all&#xA;Contributors under SectionsÃ¡2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall,&#xA;upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and&#xA;automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice period,&#xA;unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with&#xA;respect to the Participant Software against such Participant&#xA;either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with&#xA;Participant.&#xA;&#xA;6.3. In the event of termination under SectionsÃ¡6.1 or 6.2 above, all&#xA;end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any&#xA;distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses&#xA;granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.&#xA;&#xA;7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.&#xA;&#xA;UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT&#xA;(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL&#xA;DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED&#xA;SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY&#xA;PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES&#xA;OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST&#xA;PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR&#xA;MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN&#xA;IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH&#xA;DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR&#xA;DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTYS NEGLIGENCE TO THE&#xA;EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO&#xA;NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL&#xA;DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.&#xA;&#xA;8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.&#xA;&#xA;The Covered Software is a commercial item, as that term is defined in&#xA;48Ã¡C.F.R.Ã¡2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of commercial computer&#xA;software (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. Ã¡252.227-7014(a)(1))&#xA;and commercial computer software documentation as such terms are used&#xA;in 48Ã¡C.F.R.Ã¡12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and&#xA;48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all&#xA;U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only those&#xA;rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu&#xA;of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision&#xA;that addresses Government rights in computer software under this&#xA;License.&#xA;&#xA;9. MISCELLANEOUS.&#xA;&#xA;This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject&#xA;matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be&#xA;unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent&#xA;necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by&#xA;the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within the&#xA;Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any,&#xA;provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdictions conflict-of-law&#xA;provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject&#xA;to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and&#xA;venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software,&#xA;with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without&#xA;limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and&#xA;expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on&#xA;Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly&#xA;excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a&#xA;contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to&#xA;this License. You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance&#xA;with the United States export administration regulations (and the&#xA;export control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You&#xA;use, distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.&#xA;&#xA;10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.&#xA;&#xA;As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is&#xA;responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,&#xA;out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to&#xA;work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such&#xA;responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or&#xA;shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.&#xA;&#xA;NOTICE PURSUANT TO SECTION 9 OF THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND&#xA;DISTRIBUTION LICENSE (CDDL) The GlassFish code released under the CDDL&#xA;shall be governed by the laws of the State of California (excluding&#xA;conflict-of-law provisions). Any litigation relating to this License&#xA;shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the&#xA;Northern District of California and the state courts of the State of&#xA;California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California.&#xA;&#xA;For plexus-archiver-1.0-alpha-7.jar:&#xA;&#xA;=========================================================================&#xA;==  Plexus License                                                     ==&#xA;=========================================================================&#xA;&#xA;Common Public License - v 1.0 &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON &#xA;PUBLIC LICENSE (&quot;AGREEMENT&quot;). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE &#xA;PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT&apos;S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;1. DEFINITIONS &#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contribution&quot; means: &#xA;&#xA;a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and &#xA;documentation distributed under this Agreement, and&#xA;&#xA;b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:&#xA;&#xA;i) changes to the Program, and&#xA;&#xA;ii) additions to the Program;&#xA;&#xA;where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are &#xA;distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution &apos;originates&apos; &#xA;from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor &#xA;itself or anyone acting on such Contributor&apos;s behalf. Contributions do not &#xA;include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of &#xA;software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own &#xA;license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program. &#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contributor&quot; means any person or entity that distributes the Program. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Licensed Patents &quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which &#xA;are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or &#xA;when combined with the Program. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Program&quot; means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this &#xA;Agreement. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, &#xA;including all Contributors. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;2. GRANT OF RIGHTS &#xA;&#xA;a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants &#xA;Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to &#xA;reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly &#xA;perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, &#xA;if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.&#xA;&#xA;b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants &#xA;Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under &#xA;Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise &#xA;transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and &#xA;object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the &#xA;Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by &#xA;the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination &#xA;to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply &#xA;to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se &#xA;is licensed hereunder. &#xA;&#xA;c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses &#xA;to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any &#xA;Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other &#xA;intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims &#xA;any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on &#xA;infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to &#xA;exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby &#xA;assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights &#xA;needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to &#xA;allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient&apos;s responsibility &#xA;to acquire that license before distributing the Program.&#xA;&#xA;d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient &#xA;copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license &#xA;set forth in this Agreement.&#xA;&#xA;3. REQUIREMENTS &#xA;&#xA;A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under &#xA;its own license agreement, provided that: &#xA;&#xA;a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and&#xA;&#xA;b) its license agreement:&#xA;&#xA;i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and &#xA;conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title &#xA;and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability &#xA;and fitness for a particular purpose; &#xA;&#xA;ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for &#xA;damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential &#xA;damages, such as lost profits; &#xA;&#xA;iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered &#xA;by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and&#xA;&#xA;iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such &#xA;Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on &#xA;or through a medium customarily used for software exchange. &#xA;&#xA;When the Program is made available in source code form: &#xA;&#xA;a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and &#xA;&#xA;b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program. &#xA;&#xA;Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within &#xA;the Program. &#xA;&#xA;Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its &#xA;Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent &#xA;Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution. &#xA;&#xA;4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION &#xA;&#xA;Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities &#xA;with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this &#xA;license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the &#xA;Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering &#xA;should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for &#xA;other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a &#xA;commercial product offering, such Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;) &#xA;hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (&quot;Indemnified &#xA;Contributor&quot;) against any losses, damages and costs (collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) &#xA;arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third &#xA;party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts &#xA;or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its &#xA;distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The &#xA;obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating &#xA;to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to &#xA;qualify, &#xA;an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial &#xA;Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial &#xA;Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, &#xA;the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified &#xA;Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial &#xA;product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial &#xA;Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, &#xA;or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and &#xA;warranties are such Commercial Contributor&apos;s responsibility alone. Under &#xA;this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims &#xA;against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and &#xA;warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any &#xA;damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;5. NO WARRANTY &#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED &#xA;ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER &#xA;EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR &#xA;CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A &#xA;PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining &#xA;the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all &#xA;risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, &#xA;including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, &#xA;compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or &#xA;equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY &#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY &#xA;CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, &#xA;SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION &#xA;LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN &#xA;CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) &#xA;ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE &#xA;EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE &#xA;POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;7. GENERAL &#xA;&#xA;If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under &#xA;applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of &#xA;the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action &#xA;by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum &#xA;extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with &#xA;respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or &#xA;counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that &#xA;Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as &#xA;of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient &#xA;institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim &#xA;or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding &#xA;combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes &#xA;such Recipient&apos;s patent(s), then such Recipient&apos;s rights granted under &#xA;Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;All Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails &#xA;to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement &#xA;and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after &#xA;becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient&apos;s rights under this &#xA;Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the &#xA;Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient&apos;s obligations &#xA;under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the &#xA;Program shall continue and survive. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, &#xA;but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may &#xA;only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves &#xA;the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement &#xA;from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right &#xA;to modify this Agreement. IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may &#xA;assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable &#xA;separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a &#xA;distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may &#xA;always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which &#xA;it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is &#xA;published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its &#xA;Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in &#xA;Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to &#xA;the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether &#xA;expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program &#xA;not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the &#xA;intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this &#xA;Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year &#xA;after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury &#xA;trial in any resulting litigation. &#xA;&#xA;'/>

Application of Additional Terms.  You may not offer or impose any&#xA;terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form that alters or&#xA;restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients&#xA;rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,&#xA;warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more&#xA;recipients of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your&#xA;own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any&#xA;Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty,&#xA;support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone,&#xA;and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every&#xA;Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or&#xA;such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or&#xA;liability terms You offer.&#xA;&#xA;3.5.

You may distribute the&#xA;Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms of this&#xA;License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may&#xA;contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in&#xA;compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the&#xA;Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients&#xA;rights in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this&#xA;License. If You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form&#xA;under a different license, You must make it absolutely clear that any&#xA;terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by&#xA;the Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify&#xA;the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred&#xA;by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such&#xA;terms You offer.&#xA;&#xA;3.6.

Each version will be given a distinguishing version&#xA;number. Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than the&#xA;license steward has the right to modify this License.&#xA;&#xA;4.2. Effect of New Versions.&#xA;&#xA;You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the&#xA;Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the&#xA;License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If&#xA;the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software&#xA;prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available&#xA;under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and&#xA;make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of&#xA;the License under which You originally received the Covered&#xA;Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or&#xA;otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any&#xA;subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.&#xA;4.3. Modified Versions.&#xA;&#xA;When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license&#xA;for Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version&#xA;of this License if You: (a)Ã¡rename the license and remove any&#xA;references to the name of the license steward (except to note that the&#xA;license differs from this License); and (b)Ã¡otherwise make it clear&#xA;that the license contains terms which differ from this License.&#xA;&#xA;5.

Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect&#xA;beyond the termination of this License shall survive.&#xA;&#xA;6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory&#xA;judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the&#xA;Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such&#xA;claim is referred to as Participant) alleging that the&#xA;Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the&#xA;Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the&#xA;Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly&#xA;infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or&#xA;indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if&#xA;the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all&#xA;Contributors under SectionsÃ¡2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall,&#xA;upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and&#xA;automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice period,&#xA;unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with&#xA;respect to the Participant Software against such Participant&#xA;either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with&#xA;Participant.&#xA;&#xA;6.3. In the event of termination under SectionsÃ¡6.1 or 6.2 above, all&#xA;end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any&#xA;distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses&#xA;granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.&#xA;&#xA;7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.&#xA;&#xA;UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT&#xA;(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL&#xA;DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED&#xA;SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY&#xA;PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES&#xA;OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST&#xA;PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR&#xA;MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN&#xA;IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH&#xA;DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR&#xA;DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTYS NEGLIGENCE TO THE&#xA;EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO&#xA;NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL&#xA;DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.&#xA;&#xA;8.

MISCELLANEOUS.&#xA;&#xA;This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject&#xA;matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be&#xA;unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent&#xA;necessary to make it enforceable.

RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.&#xA;&#xA;As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is&#xA;responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,&#xA;out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to&#xA;work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such&#xA;responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or&#xA;shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.&#xA;&#xA;NOTICE PURSUANT TO SECTION 9 OF THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND&#xA;DISTRIBUTION LICENSE (CDDL) The GlassFish code released under the CDDL&#xA;shall be governed by the laws of the State of California (excluding&#xA;conflict-of-law provisions). Any litigation relating to this License&#xA;shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the&#xA;Northern District of California and the state courts of the State of&#xA;California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California.&#xA;&#xA;For plexus-archiver-1.0-alpha-7.jar:&#xA;&#xA;=========================================================================&#xA;==  Plexus License                                                     ==&#xA;=========================================================================&#xA;&#xA;Common Public License - v 1.0 &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON &#xA;PUBLIC LICENSE (&quot;AGREEMENT&quot;). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE &#xA;PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT&apos;S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;1. DEFINITIONS &#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contribution&quot; means: &#xA;&#xA;a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and &#xA;documentation distributed under this Agreement, and&#xA;&#xA;b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:&#xA;&#xA;i) changes to the Program, and&#xA;&#xA;ii) additions to the Program;&#xA;&#xA;where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are &#xA;distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution &apos;originates&apos; &#xA;from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor &#xA;itself or anyone acting on such Contributor&apos;s behalf. Contributions do not &#xA;include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of &#xA;software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own &#xA;license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program. &#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contributor&quot; means any person or entity that distributes the Program. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Licensed Patents &quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which &#xA;are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or &#xA;when combined with the Program. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Program&quot; means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this &#xA;Agreement. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, &#xA;including all Contributors. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;2. GRANT OF RIGHTS &#xA;&#xA;a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants &#xA;Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to &#xA;reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly &#xA;perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, &#xA;if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.&#xA;&#xA;b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants &#xA;Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under &#xA;Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise &#xA;transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and &#xA;object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the &#xA;Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by &#xA;the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination &#xA;to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply &#xA;to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se &#xA;is licensed hereunder. &#xA;&#xA;c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses &#xA;to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any &#xA;Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other &#xA;intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims &#xA;any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on &#xA;infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to &#xA;exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby &#xA;assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights &#xA;needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to &#xA;allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient&apos;s responsibility &#xA;to acquire that license before distributing the Program.&#xA;&#xA;d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient &#xA;copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license &#xA;set forth in this Agreement.&#xA;&#xA;3. REQUIREMENTS &#xA;&#xA;A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under &#xA;its own license agreement, provided that: &#xA;&#xA;a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and&#xA;&#xA;b) its license agreement:&#xA;&#xA;i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and &#xA;conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title &#xA;and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability &#xA;and fitness for a particular purpose; &#xA;&#xA;ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for &#xA;damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential &#xA;damages, such as lost profits; &#xA;&#xA;iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered &#xA;by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and&#xA;&#xA;iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such &#xA;Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on &#xA;or through a medium customarily used for software exchange. &#xA;&#xA;When the Program is made available in source code form: &#xA;&#xA;a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and &#xA;&#xA;b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program. &#xA;&#xA;Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within &#xA;the Program. &#xA;&#xA;Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its &#xA;Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent &#xA;Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution. &#xA;&#xA;4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION &#xA;&#xA;Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities &#xA;with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this &#xA;license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the &#xA;Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering &#xA;should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for &#xA;other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a &#xA;commercial product offering, such Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;) &#xA;hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (&quot;Indemnified &#xA;Contributor&quot;) against any losses, damages and costs (collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) &#xA;arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third &#xA;party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts &#xA;or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its &#xA;distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The &#xA;obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating &#xA;to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to &#xA;qualify, &#xA;an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial &#xA;Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial &#xA;Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, &#xA;the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified &#xA;Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial &#xA;product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial &#xA;Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, &#xA;or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and &#xA;warranties are such Commercial Contributor&apos;s responsibility alone. Under &#xA;this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims &#xA;against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and &#xA;warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any &#xA;damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;5. NO WARRANTY &#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED &#xA;ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER &#xA;EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR &#xA;CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A &#xA;PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining &#xA;the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all &#xA;risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, &#xA;including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, &#xA;compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or &#xA;equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY &#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY &#xA;CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, &#xA;SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION &#xA;LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN &#xA;CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) &#xA;ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE &#xA;EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE &#xA;POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;7. GENERAL &#xA;&#xA;If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under &#xA;applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of &#xA;the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action &#xA;by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum &#xA;extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with &#xA;respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or &#xA;counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that &#xA;Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as &#xA;of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient &#xA;institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim &#xA;or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding &#xA;combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes &#xA;such Recipient&apos;s patent(s), then such Recipient&apos;s rights granted under &#xA;Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;All Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails &#xA;to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement &#xA;and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after &#xA;becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient&apos;s rights under this &#xA;Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the &#xA;Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient&apos;s obligations &#xA;under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the &#xA;Program shall continue and survive. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, &#xA;but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may &#xA;only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves &#xA;the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement &#xA;from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right &#xA;to modify this Agreement. IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may &#xA;assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable &#xA;separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a &#xA;distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may &#xA;always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which &#xA;it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is &#xA;published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its &#xA;Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in &#xA;Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to &#xA;the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether &#xA;expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program &#xA;not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the &#xA;intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this &#xA;Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year &#xA;after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury &#xA;trial in any resulting litigation. &#xA;&#xA;'/>

DEFINITIONS &#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contribution&quot; means: &#xA;&#xA;a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and &#xA;documentation distributed under this Agreement, and&#xA;&#xA;b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:&#xA;&#xA;i) changes to the Program, and&#xA;&#xA;ii) additions to the Program;&#xA;&#xA;where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are &#xA;distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution &apos;originates&apos; &#xA;from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor &#xA;itself or anyone acting on such Contributor&apos;s behalf. Contributions do not &#xA;include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of &#xA;software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own &#xA;license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program. &#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contributor&quot; means any person or entity that distributes the Program. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Licensed Patents &quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which &#xA;are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or &#xA;when combined with the Program. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Program&quot; means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this &#xA;Agreement. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, &#xA;including all Contributors. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;2. GRANT OF RIGHTS &#xA;&#xA;a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants &#xA;Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to &#xA;reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly &#xA;perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, &#xA;if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.&#xA;&#xA;b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants &#xA;Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under &#xA;Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise &#xA;transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and &#xA;object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the &#xA;Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by &#xA;the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination &#xA;to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply &#xA;to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se &#xA;is licensed hereunder. &#xA;&#xA;c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses &#xA;to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any &#xA;Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other &#xA;intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims &#xA;any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on &#xA;infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to &#xA;exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby &#xA;assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights &#xA;needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to &#xA;allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient&apos;s responsibility &#xA;to acquire that license before distributing the Program.&#xA;&#xA;d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient &#xA;copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license &#xA;set forth in this Agreement.&#xA;&#xA;3. REQUIREMENTS &#xA;&#xA;A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under &#xA;its own license agreement, provided that: &#xA;&#xA;a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and&#xA;&#xA;b) its license agreement:&#xA;&#xA;i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and &#xA;conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title &#xA;and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability &#xA;and fitness for a particular purpose; &#xA;&#xA;ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for &#xA;damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential &#xA;damages, such as lost profits; &#xA;&#xA;iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered &#xA;by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and&#xA;&#xA;iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such &#xA;Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on &#xA;or through a medium customarily used for software exchange. &#xA;&#xA;When the Program is made available in source code form: &#xA;&#xA;a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and &#xA;&#xA;b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program. &#xA;&#xA;Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within &#xA;the Program. &#xA;&#xA;Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its &#xA;Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent &#xA;Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution. &#xA;&#xA;4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION &#xA;&#xA;Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities &#xA;with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this &#xA;license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the &#xA;Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering &#xA;should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for &#xA;other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a &#xA;commercial product offering, such Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;) &#xA;hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (&quot;Indemnified &#xA;Contributor&quot;) against any losses, damages and costs (collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) &#xA;arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third &#xA;party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts &#xA;or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its &#xA;distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The &#xA;obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating &#xA;to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to &#xA;qualify, &#xA;an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial &#xA;Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial &#xA;Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, &#xA;the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified &#xA;Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial &#xA;product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial &#xA;Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, &#xA;or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and &#xA;warranties are such Commercial Contributor&apos;s responsibility alone. Under &#xA;this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims &#xA;against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and &#xA;warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any &#xA;damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;5. NO WARRANTY &#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED &#xA;ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER &#xA;EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR &#xA;CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A &#xA;PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining &#xA;the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all &#xA;risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, &#xA;including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, &#xA;compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or &#xA;equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY &#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY &#xA;CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, &#xA;SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION &#xA;LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN &#xA;CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) &#xA;ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE &#xA;EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE &#xA;POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;7. GENERAL &#xA;&#xA;If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under &#xA;applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of &#xA;the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action &#xA;by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum &#xA;extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with &#xA;respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or &#xA;counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that &#xA;Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as &#xA;of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient &#xA;institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim &#xA;or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding &#xA;combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes &#xA;such Recipient&apos;s patent(s), then such Recipient&apos;s rights granted under &#xA;Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;All Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails &#xA;to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement &#xA;and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after &#xA;becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient&apos;s rights under this &#xA;Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the &#xA;Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient&apos;s obligations &#xA;under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the &#xA;Program shall continue and survive. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, &#xA;but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may &#xA;only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves &#xA;the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement &#xA;from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right &#xA;to modify this Agreement. IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may &#xA;assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable &#xA;separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a &#xA;distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may &#xA;always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which &#xA;it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is &#xA;published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its &#xA;Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in &#xA;Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to &#xA;the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether &#xA;expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program &#xA;not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the &#xA;intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this &#xA;Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year &#xA;after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury &#xA;trial in any resulting litigation. &#xA;'/>

Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the&#xA;Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without&#xA;modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You&#xA;meet the following conditions:&#xA;&#xA;(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or&#xA;Derivative Works a copy of this License; and&#xA;&#xA;(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices&#xA;stating that You changed the files; and&#xA;&#xA;(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works&#xA;that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and&#xA;attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,&#xA;excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of&#xA;the Derivative Works; and&#xA;&#xA;(d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its&#xA;distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must&#xA;include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained&#xA;within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not&#xA;pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one&#xA;of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed&#xA;as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or&#xA;documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,&#xA;within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and&#xA;wherever such third-party notices normally appear.

Distribution Obligations.&#xA;&#xA;3.1. Availability of Source Code.&#xA;&#xA;Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available&#xA;in Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form and&#xA;that Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms of this&#xA;License. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of&#xA;the Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or&#xA;otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any such&#xA;Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can obtain such&#xA;Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or&#xA;through a medium customarily used for software exchange.&#xA;&#xA;3.2. Modifications.&#xA;&#xA;The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are&#xA;governed by the terms of this License. You represent that You believe&#xA;Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You have&#xA;sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.&#xA;&#xA;3.3. Required Notices.  You must include a notice in each of Your&#xA;Modifications that identifies You as the Contributor of the&#xA;Modification. You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or&#xA;trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, or any&#xA;notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving attribution to any&#xA;Contributor or the Initial Developer.&#xA;&#xA;3.4. Application of Additional Terms.  You may not offer or impose any&#xA;terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form that alters or&#xA;restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients&#xA;rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,&#xA;warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more&#xA;recipients of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your&#xA;own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any&#xA;Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty,&#xA;support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone,&#xA;and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every&#xA;Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or&#xA;such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or&#xA;liability terms You offer.&#xA;&#xA;3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.  You may distribute the&#xA;Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms of this&#xA;License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may&#xA;contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in&#xA;compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the&#xA;Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients&#xA;rights in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this&#xA;License. If You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form&#xA;under a different license, You must make it absolutely clear that any&#xA;terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by&#xA;the Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify&#xA;the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred&#xA;by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such&#xA;terms You offer.&#xA;&#xA;3.6. Larger Works.  You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered&#xA;Software with other code not governed by the terms of this License and&#xA;distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You&#xA;must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the&#xA;Covered Software.&#xA;&#xA;4. Versions of the License.&#xA;&#xA;4.1. New Versions.  Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license&#xA;steward and may publish revised and/or new versions of this License&#xA;from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version&#xA;number. Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than the&#xA;license steward has the right to modify this License.&#xA;&#xA;4.2. Effect of New Versions.&#xA;&#xA;You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the&#xA;Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the&#xA;License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If&#xA;the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software&#xA;prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available&#xA;under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and&#xA;make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of&#xA;the License under which You originally received the Covered&#xA;Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or&#xA;otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any&#xA;subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.&#xA;4.3. Modified Versions.&#xA;&#xA;When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license&#xA;for Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version&#xA;of this License if You: (a)Ã¡rename the license and remove any&#xA;references to the name of the license steward (except to note that the&#xA;license differs from this License); and (b)Ã¡otherwise make it clear&#xA;that the license contains terms which differ from this License.&#xA;&#xA;5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.&#xA;&#xA;COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN AS IS BASIS,&#xA;WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,&#xA;WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF&#xA;DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR&#xA;NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF&#xA;THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE&#xA;DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER&#xA;CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR&#xA;CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART&#xA;OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED&#xA;HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.&#xA;&#xA;6. TERMINATION.&#xA;&#xA;6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate&#xA;automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to&#xA;cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the&#xA;breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect&#xA;beyond the termination of this License shall survive.&#xA;&#xA;6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory&#xA;judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the&#xA;Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such&#xA;claim is referred to as Participant) alleging that the&#xA;Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the&#xA;Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the&#xA;Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly&#xA;infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or&#xA;indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if&#xA;the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all&#xA;Contributors under SectionsÃ¡2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall,&#xA;upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and&#xA;automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice period,&#xA;unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with&#xA;respect to the Participant Software against such Participant&#xA;either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with&#xA;Participant.&#xA;&#xA;6.3. In the event of termination under SectionsÃ¡6.1 or 6.2 above, all&#xA;end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any&#xA;distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses&#xA;granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.&#xA;&#xA;7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.&#xA;&#xA;UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT&#xA;(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL&#xA;DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED&#xA;SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY&#xA;PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES&#xA;OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST&#xA;PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR&#xA;MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN&#xA;IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH&#xA;DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR&#xA;DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTYS NEGLIGENCE TO THE&#xA;EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO&#xA;NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL&#xA;DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.&#xA;&#xA;8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.&#xA;&#xA;The Covered Software is a commercial item, as that term is defined in&#xA;48Ã¡C.F.R.Ã¡2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of commercial computer&#xA;software (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. Ã¡252.227-7014(a)(1))&#xA;and commercial computer software documentation as such terms are used&#xA;in 48Ã¡C.F.R.Ã¡12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and&#xA;48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all&#xA;U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only those&#xA;rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu&#xA;of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision&#xA;that addresses Government rights in computer software under this&#xA;License.&#xA;&#xA;9. MISCELLANEOUS.&#xA;&#xA;This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject&#xA;matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be&#xA;unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent&#xA;necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by&#xA;the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within the&#xA;Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any,&#xA;provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdictions conflict-of-law&#xA;provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject&#xA;to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and&#xA;venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software,&#xA;with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without&#xA;limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and&#xA;expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on&#xA;Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly&#xA;excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a&#xA;contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to&#xA;this License. You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance&#xA;with the United States export administration regulations (and the&#xA;export control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You&#xA;use, distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.&#xA;&#xA;10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.&#xA;&#xA;As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is&#xA;responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,&#xA;out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to&#xA;work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such&#xA;responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or&#xA;shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.&#xA;&#xA;NOTICE PURSUANT TO SECTION 9 OF THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND&#xA;DISTRIBUTION LICENSE (CDDL) The GlassFish code released under the CDDL&#xA;shall be governed by the laws of the State of California (excluding&#xA;conflict-of-law provisions). Any litigation relating to this License&#xA;shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the&#xA;Northern District of California and the state courts of the State of&#xA;California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California.&#xA;&#xA;For plexus-archiver-1.0-alpha-7.jar:&#xA;&#xA;=========================================================================&#xA;==  Plexus License                                                     ==&#xA;=========================================================================&#xA;&#xA;Common Public License - v 1.0 &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON &#xA;PUBLIC LICENSE (&quot;AGREEMENT&quot;). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE &#xA;PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT&apos;S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;1. DEFINITIONS &#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contribution&quot; means: &#xA;&#xA;a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and &#xA;documentation distributed under this Agreement, and&#xA;&#xA;b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:&#xA;&#xA;i) changes to the Program, and&#xA;&#xA;ii) additions to the Program;&#xA;&#xA;where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are &#xA;distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution &apos;originates&apos; &#xA;from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor &#xA;itself or anyone acting on such Contributor&apos;s behalf. Contributions do not &#xA;include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of &#xA;software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own &#xA;license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program. &#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contributor&quot; means any person or entity that distributes the Program. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Licensed Patents &quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which &#xA;are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or &#xA;when combined with the Program. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Program&quot; means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this &#xA;Agreement. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, &#xA;including all Contributors. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;2. GRANT OF RIGHTS &#xA;&#xA;a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants &#xA;Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to &#xA;reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly &#xA;perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, &#xA;if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.&#xA;&#xA;b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants &#xA;Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under &#xA;Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise &#xA;transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and &#xA;object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the &#xA;Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by &#xA;the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination &#xA;to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply &#xA;to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se &#xA;is licensed hereunder. &#xA;&#xA;c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses &#xA;to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any &#xA;Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other &#xA;intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims &#xA;any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on &#xA;infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to &#xA;exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby &#xA;assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights &#xA;needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to &#xA;allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient&apos;s responsibility &#xA;to acquire that license before distributing the Program.&#xA;&#xA;d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient &#xA;copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license &#xA;set forth in this Agreement.&#xA;&#xA;3. REQUIREMENTS &#xA;&#xA;A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under &#xA;its own license agreement, provided that: &#xA;&#xA;a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and&#xA;&#xA;b) its license agreement:&#xA;&#xA;i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and &#xA;conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title &#xA;and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability &#xA;and fitness for a particular purpose; &#xA;&#xA;ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for &#xA;damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential &#xA;damages, such as lost profits; &#xA;&#xA;iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered &#xA;by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and&#xA;&#xA;iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such &#xA;Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on &#xA;or through a medium customarily used for software exchange. &#xA;&#xA;When the Program is made available in source code form: &#xA;&#xA;a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and &#xA;&#xA;b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program. &#xA;&#xA;Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within &#xA;the Program. &#xA;&#xA;Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its &#xA;Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent &#xA;Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution. &#xA;&#xA;4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION &#xA;&#xA;Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities &#xA;with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this &#xA;license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the &#xA;Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering &#xA;should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for &#xA;other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a &#xA;commercial product offering, such Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;) &#xA;hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (&quot;Indemnified &#xA;Contributor&quot;) against any losses, damages and costs (collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) &#xA;arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third &#xA;party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts &#xA;or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its &#xA;distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The &#xA;obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating &#xA;to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to &#xA;qualify, &#xA;an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial &#xA;Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial &#xA;Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, &#xA;the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified &#xA;Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial &#xA;product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial &#xA;Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, &#xA;or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and &#xA;warranties are such Commercial Contributor&apos;s responsibility alone. Under &#xA;this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims &#xA;against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and &#xA;warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any &#xA;damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;5. NO WARRANTY &#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED &#xA;ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER &#xA;EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR &#xA;CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A &#xA;PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining &#xA;the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all &#xA;risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, &#xA;including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, &#xA;compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or &#xA;equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY &#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY &#xA;CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, &#xA;SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION &#xA;LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN &#xA;CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) &#xA;ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE &#xA;EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE &#xA;POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;7. GENERAL &#xA;&#xA;If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under &#xA;applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of &#xA;the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action &#xA;by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum &#xA;extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with &#xA;respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or &#xA;counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that &#xA;Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as &#xA;of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient &#xA;institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim &#xA;or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding &#xA;combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes &#xA;such Recipient&apos;s patent(s), then such Recipient&apos;s rights granted under &#xA;Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;All Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails &#xA;to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement &#xA;and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after &#xA;becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient&apos;s rights under this &#xA;Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the &#xA;Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient&apos;s obligations &#xA;under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the &#xA;Program shall continue and survive. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, &#xA;but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may &#xA;only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves &#xA;the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement &#xA;from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right &#xA;to modify this Agreement. IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may &#xA;assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable &#xA;separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a &#xA;distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may &#xA;always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which &#xA;it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is &#xA;published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its &#xA;Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in &#xA;Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to &#xA;the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether &#xA;expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program &#xA;not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the &#xA;intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this &#xA;Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year &#xA;after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury &#xA;trial in any resulting litigation. &#xA;&#xA;'/>

Distribution Obligations.&#xA;&#xA;3.1. Availability of Source Code.&#xA;&#xA;Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available&#xA;in Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form and&#xA;that Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms of this&#xA;License. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of&#xA;the Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or&#xA;otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any such&#xA;Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can obtain such&#xA;Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or&#xA;through a medium customarily used for software exchange.&#xA;&#xA;3.2. Modifications.&#xA;&#xA;The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are&#xA;governed by the terms of this License. You represent that You believe&#xA;Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You have&#xA;sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.&#xA;&#xA;3.3. Required Notices.  You must include a notice in each of Your&#xA;Modifications that identifies You as the Contributor of the&#xA;Modification. You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or&#xA;trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, or any&#xA;notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving attribution to any&#xA;Contributor or the Initial Developer.&#xA;&#xA;3.4. Application of Additional Terms.  You may not offer or impose any&#xA;terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form that alters or&#xA;restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients&#xA;rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,&#xA;warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more&#xA;recipients of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your&#xA;own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any&#xA;Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty,&#xA;support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone,&#xA;and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every&#xA;Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or&#xA;such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or&#xA;liability terms You offer.&#xA;&#xA;3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.  You may distribute the&#xA;Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms of this&#xA;License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may&#xA;contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in&#xA;compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the&#xA;Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients&#xA;rights in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this&#xA;License. If You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form&#xA;under a different license, You must make it absolutely clear that any&#xA;terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by&#xA;the Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify&#xA;the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred&#xA;by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such&#xA;terms You offer.&#xA;&#xA;3.6. Larger Works.  You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered&#xA;Software with other code not governed by the terms of this License and&#xA;distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You&#xA;must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the&#xA;Covered Software.&#xA;&#xA;4. Versions of the License.&#xA;&#xA;4.1. New Versions.  Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license&#xA;steward and may publish revised and/or new versions of this License&#xA;from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version&#xA;number. Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than the&#xA;license steward has the right to modify this License.&#xA;&#xA;4.2. Effect of New Versions.&#xA;&#xA;You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the&#xA;Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the&#xA;License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If&#xA;the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software&#xA;prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available&#xA;under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and&#xA;make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of&#xA;the License under which You originally received the Covered&#xA;Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or&#xA;otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any&#xA;subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.&#xA;4.3. Modified Versions.&#xA;&#xA;When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license&#xA;for Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version&#xA;of this License if You: (a)Ã¡rename the license and remove any&#xA;references to the name of the license steward (except to note that the&#xA;license differs from this License); and (b)Ã¡otherwise make it clear&#xA;that the license contains terms which differ from this License.&#xA;&#xA;5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.&#xA;&#xA;COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN AS IS BASIS,&#xA;WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,&#xA;WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF&#xA;DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR&#xA;NON-INFRINGING.

TERMINATION.&#xA;&#xA;6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate&#xA;automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to&#xA;cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the&#xA;breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect&#xA;beyond the termination of this License shall survive.&#xA;&#xA;6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory&#xA;judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the&#xA;Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such&#xA;claim is referred to as Participant) alleging that the&#xA;Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the&#xA;Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the&#xA;Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly&#xA;infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or&#xA;indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if&#xA;the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all&#xA;Contributors under SectionsÃ¡2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall,&#xA;upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and&#xA;automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice period,&#xA;unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with&#xA;respect to the Participant Software against such Participant&#xA;either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with&#xA;Participant.&#xA;&#xA;6.3. In the event of termination under SectionsÃ¡6.1 or 6.2 above, all&#xA;end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any&#xA;distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses&#xA;granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.&#xA;&#xA;7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.&#xA;&#xA;UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT&#xA;(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL&#xA;DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED&#xA;SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY&#xA;PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES&#xA;OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST&#xA;PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR&#xA;MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN&#xA;IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH&#xA;DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR&#xA;DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTYS NEGLIGENCE TO THE&#xA;EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO&#xA;NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL&#xA;DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.&#xA;&#xA;8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.&#xA;&#xA;The Covered Software is a commercial item, as that term is defined in&#xA;48Ã¡C.F.R.Ã¡2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of commercial computer&#xA;software (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. Ã¡252.227-7014(a)(1))&#xA;and commercial computer software documentation as such terms are used&#xA;in 48Ã¡C.F.R.Ã¡12.212 (Sept. 1995).

This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu&#xA;of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision&#xA;that addresses Government rights in computer software under this&#xA;License.&#xA;&#xA;9. MISCELLANEOUS.&#xA;&#xA;This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject&#xA;matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be&#xA;unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent&#xA;necessary to make it enforceable.

Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject&#xA;to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and&#xA;venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software,&#xA;with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without&#xA;limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and&#xA;expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on&#xA;Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly&#xA;excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a&#xA;contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to&#xA;this License.

Any litigation relating to this License&#xA;shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the&#xA;Northern District of California and the state courts of the State of&#xA;California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California.&#xA;&#xA;For plexus-archiver-1.0-alpha-7.jar:&#xA;&#xA;=========================================================================&#xA;==  Plexus License                                                     ==&#xA;=========================================================================&#xA;&#xA;Common Public License - v 1.0 &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON &#xA;PUBLIC LICENSE (&quot;AGREEMENT&quot;). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE &#xA;PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT&apos;S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;1. DEFINITIONS &#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contribution&quot; means: &#xA;&#xA;a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and &#xA;documentation distributed under this Agreement, and&#xA;&#xA;b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:&#xA;&#xA;i) changes to the Program, and&#xA;&#xA;ii) additions to the Program;&#xA;&#xA;where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are &#xA;distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution &apos;originates&apos; &#xA;from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor &#xA;itself or anyone acting on such Contributor&apos;s behalf. Contributions do not &#xA;include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of &#xA;software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own &#xA;license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program. &#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contributor&quot; means any person or entity that distributes the Program. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Licensed Patents &quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which &#xA;are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or &#xA;when combined with the Program. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Program&quot; means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this &#xA;Agreement. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, &#xA;including all Contributors. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;2. GRANT OF RIGHTS &#xA;&#xA;a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants &#xA;Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to &#xA;reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly &#xA;perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, &#xA;if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.&#xA;&#xA;b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants &#xA;Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under &#xA;Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise &#xA;transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and &#xA;object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the &#xA;Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by &#xA;the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination &#xA;to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply &#xA;to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se &#xA;is licensed hereunder. &#xA;&#xA;c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses &#xA;to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any &#xA;Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other &#xA;intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims &#xA;any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on &#xA;infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to &#xA;exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby &#xA;assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights &#xA;needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to &#xA;allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient&apos;s responsibility &#xA;to acquire that license before distributing the Program.&#xA;&#xA;d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient &#xA;copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license &#xA;set forth in this Agreement.&#xA;&#xA;3. REQUIREMENTS &#xA;&#xA;A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under &#xA;its own license agreement, provided that: &#xA;&#xA;a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and&#xA;&#xA;b) its license agreement:&#xA;&#xA;i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and &#xA;conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title &#xA;and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability &#xA;and fitness for a particular purpose; &#xA;&#xA;ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for &#xA;damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential &#xA;damages, such as lost profits; &#xA;&#xA;iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered &#xA;by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and&#xA;&#xA;iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such &#xA;Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on &#xA;or through a medium customarily used for software exchange. &#xA;&#xA;When the Program is made available in source code form: &#xA;&#xA;a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and &#xA;&#xA;b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program. &#xA;&#xA;Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within &#xA;the Program. &#xA;&#xA;Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its &#xA;Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent &#xA;Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution. &#xA;&#xA;4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION &#xA;&#xA;Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities &#xA;with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this &#xA;license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the &#xA;Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering &#xA;should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for &#xA;other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a &#xA;commercial product offering, such Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;) &#xA;hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (&quot;Indemnified &#xA;Contributor&quot;) against any losses, damages and costs (collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) &#xA;arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third &#xA;party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts &#xA;or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its &#xA;distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The &#xA;obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating &#xA;to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to &#xA;qualify, &#xA;an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial &#xA;Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial &#xA;Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, &#xA;the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified &#xA;Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial &#xA;product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial &#xA;Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, &#xA;or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and &#xA;warranties are such Commercial Contributor&apos;s responsibility alone. Under &#xA;this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims &#xA;against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and &#xA;warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any &#xA;damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;5. NO WARRANTY &#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED &#xA;ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER &#xA;EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR &#xA;CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A &#xA;PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining &#xA;the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all &#xA;risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, &#xA;including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, &#xA;compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or &#xA;equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY &#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY &#xA;CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, &#xA;SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION &#xA;LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN &#xA;CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) &#xA;ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE &#xA;EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE &#xA;POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;7. GENERAL &#xA;&#xA;If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under &#xA;applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of &#xA;the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action &#xA;by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum &#xA;extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with &#xA;respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or &#xA;counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that &#xA;Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as &#xA;of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient &#xA;institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim &#xA;or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding &#xA;combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes &#xA;such Recipient&apos;s patent(s), then such Recipient&apos;s rights granted under &#xA;Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;All Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails &#xA;to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement &#xA;and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after &#xA;becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient&apos;s rights under this &#xA;Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the &#xA;Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient&apos;s obligations &#xA;under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the &#xA;Program shall continue and survive. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, &#xA;but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may &#xA;only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves &#xA;the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement &#xA;from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right &#xA;to modify this Agreement. IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may &#xA;assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable &#xA;separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a &#xA;distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may &#xA;always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which &#xA;it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is &#xA;published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its &#xA;Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in &#xA;Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to &#xA;the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether &#xA;expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program &#xA;not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the &#xA;intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this &#xA;Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year &#xA;after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury &#xA;trial in any resulting litigation. &#xA;&#xA;'/>

Distribution Obligations.&#xA;&#xA;3.1. Availability of Source Code.&#xA;&#xA;Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available&#xA;in Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form and&#xA;that Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms of this&#xA;License. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of&#xA;the Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or&#xA;otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any such&#xA;Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can obtain such&#xA;Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or&#xA;through a medium customarily used for software exchange.&#xA;&#xA;3.2. Modifications.&#xA;&#xA;The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are&#xA;governed by the terms of this License. You represent that You believe&#xA;Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You have&#xA;sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.&#xA;&#xA;3.3. Required Notices.  You must include a notice in each of Your&#xA;Modifications that identifies You as the Contributor of the&#xA;Modification. You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or&#xA;trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, or any&#xA;notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving attribution to any&#xA;Contributor or the Initial Developer.&#xA;&#xA;3.4. Application of Additional Terms.  You may not offer or impose any&#xA;terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form that alters or&#xA;restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients&#xA;rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,&#xA;warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more&#xA;recipients of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your&#xA;own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any&#xA;Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty,&#xA;support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone,&#xA;and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every&#xA;Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or&#xA;such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or&#xA;liability terms You offer.&#xA;&#xA;3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.  You may distribute the&#xA;Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms of this&#xA;License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may&#xA;contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in&#xA;compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the&#xA;Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients&#xA;rights in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this&#xA;License. If You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form&#xA;under a different license, You must make it absolutely clear that any&#xA;terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by&#xA;the Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify&#xA;the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred&#xA;by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such&#xA;terms You offer.&#xA;&#xA;3.6. Larger Works.  You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered&#xA;Software with other code not governed by the terms of this License and&#xA;distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You&#xA;must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the&#xA;Covered Software.&#xA;&#xA;4. Versions of the License.&#xA;&#xA;4.1. New Versions.  Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license&#xA;steward and may publish revised and/or new versions of this License&#xA;from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version&#xA;number. Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than the&#xA;license steward has the right to modify this License.&#xA;&#xA;4.2. Effect of New Versions.&#xA;&#xA;You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the&#xA;Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the&#xA;License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If&#xA;the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software&#xA;prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available&#xA;under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and&#xA;make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of&#xA;the License under which You originally received the Covered&#xA;Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or&#xA;otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any&#xA;subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.&#xA;4.3. Modified Versions.&#xA;&#xA;When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license&#xA;for Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version&#xA;of this License if You: (a)Ã¡rename the license and remove any&#xA;references to the name of the license steward (except to note that the&#xA;license differs from this License); and (b)Ã¡otherwise make it clear&#xA;that the license contains terms which differ from this License.&#xA;&#xA;5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.&#xA;&#xA;COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN AS IS BASIS,&#xA;WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,&#xA;WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF&#xA;DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR&#xA;NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF&#xA;THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE&#xA;DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER&#xA;CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR&#xA;CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART&#xA;OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED&#xA;HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.&#xA;&#xA;6. TERMINATION.&#xA;&#xA;6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate&#xA;automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to&#xA;cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the&#xA;breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect&#xA;beyond the termination of this License shall survive.&#xA;&#xA;6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory&#xA;judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the&#xA;Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such&#xA;claim is referred to as Participant) alleging that the&#xA;Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the&#xA;Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the&#xA;Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly&#xA;infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or&#xA;indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if&#xA;the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all&#xA;Contributors under SectionsÃ¡2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall,&#xA;upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and&#xA;automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice period,&#xA;unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with&#xA;respect to the Participant Software against such Participant&#xA;either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with&#xA;Participant.&#xA;&#xA;6.3. In the event of termination under SectionsÃ¡6.1 or 6.2 above, all&#xA;end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any&#xA;distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses&#xA;granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.&#xA;&#xA;7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.&#xA;&#xA;UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT&#xA;(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL&#xA;DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED&#xA;SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY&#xA;PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES&#xA;OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST&#xA;PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR&#xA;MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN&#xA;IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH&#xA;DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR&#xA;DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTYS NEGLIGENCE TO THE&#xA;EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO&#xA;NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL&#xA;DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.&#xA;&#xA;8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.&#xA;&#xA;The Covered Software is a commercial item, as that term is defined in&#xA;48Ã¡C.F.R.Ã¡2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of commercial computer&#xA;software (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. Ã¡252.227-7014(a)(1))&#xA;and commercial computer software documentation as such terms are used&#xA;in 48Ã¡C.F.R.Ã¡12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and&#xA;48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all&#xA;U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only those&#xA;rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu&#xA;of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision&#xA;that addresses Government rights in computer software under this&#xA;License.&#xA;&#xA;9. MISCELLANEOUS.&#xA;&#xA;This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject&#xA;matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be&#xA;unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent&#xA;necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by&#xA;the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within the&#xA;Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any,&#xA;provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdictions conflict-of-law&#xA;provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject&#xA;to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and&#xA;venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software,&#xA;with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without&#xA;limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and&#xA;expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on&#xA;Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly&#xA;excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a&#xA;contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to&#xA;this License. You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance&#xA;with the United States export administration regulations (and the&#xA;export control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You&#xA;use, distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.&#xA;&#xA;10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.&#xA;&#xA;As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is&#xA;responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,&#xA;out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to&#xA;work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such&#xA;responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or&#xA;shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.&#xA;&#xA;NOTICE PURSUANT TO SECTION 9 OF THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND&#xA;DISTRIBUTION LICENSE (CDDL) The GlassFish code released under the CDDL&#xA;shall be governed by the laws of the State of California (excluding&#xA;conflict-of-law provisions). Any litigation relating to this License&#xA;shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the&#xA;Northern District of California and the state courts of the State of&#xA;California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California.&#xA;&#xA;For plexus-archiver-1.0-alpha-7.jar:&#xA;&#xA;=========================================================================&#xA;==  Plexus License                                                     ==&#xA;=========================================================================&#xA;&#xA;Common Public License - v 1.0 &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON &#xA;PUBLIC LICENSE (&quot;AGREEMENT&quot;). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE &#xA;PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT&apos;S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;1. DEFINITIONS &#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contribution&quot; means: &#xA;&#xA;a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and &#xA;documentation distributed under this Agreement, and&#xA;&#xA;b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:&#xA;&#xA;i) changes to the Program, and&#xA;&#xA;ii) additions to the Program;&#xA;&#xA;where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are &#xA;distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution &apos;originates&apos; &#xA;from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor &#xA;itself or anyone acting on such Contributor&apos;s behalf. Contributions do not &#xA;include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of &#xA;software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own &#xA;license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program. &#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contributor&quot; means any person or entity that distributes the Program. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Licensed Patents &quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which &#xA;are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or &#xA;when combined with the Program. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Program&quot; means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this &#xA;Agreement. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, &#xA;including all Contributors. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;2. GRANT OF RIGHTS &#xA;&#xA;a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants &#xA;Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to &#xA;reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly &#xA;perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, &#xA;if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.&#xA;&#xA;b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants &#xA;Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under &#xA;Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise &#xA;transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and &#xA;object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the &#xA;Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by &#xA;the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination &#xA;to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply &#xA;to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se &#xA;is licensed hereunder. &#xA;&#xA;c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses &#xA;to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any &#xA;Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other &#xA;intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims &#xA;any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on &#xA;infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to &#xA;exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby &#xA;assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights &#xA;needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to &#xA;allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient&apos;s responsibility &#xA;to acquire that license before distributing the Program.&#xA;&#xA;d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient &#xA;copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license &#xA;set forth in this Agreement.&#xA;&#xA;3. REQUIREMENTS &#xA;&#xA;A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under &#xA;its own license agreement, provided that: &#xA;&#xA;a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and&#xA;&#xA;b) its license agreement:&#xA;&#xA;i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and &#xA;conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title &#xA;and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability &#xA;and fitness for a particular purpose; &#xA;&#xA;ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for &#xA;damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential &#xA;damages, such as lost profits; &#xA;&#xA;iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered &#xA;by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and&#xA;&#xA;iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such &#xA;Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on &#xA;or through a medium customarily used for software exchange. &#xA;&#xA;When the Program is made available in source code form: &#xA;&#xA;a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and &#xA;&#xA;b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program. &#xA;&#xA;Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within &#xA;the Program. &#xA;&#xA;Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its &#xA;Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent &#xA;Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution. &#xA;&#xA;4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION &#xA;&#xA;Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities &#xA;with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this &#xA;license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the &#xA;Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering &#xA;should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for &#xA;other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a &#xA;commercial product offering, such Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;) &#xA;hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (&quot;Indemnified &#xA;Contributor&quot;) against any losses, damages and costs (collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) &#xA;arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third &#xA;party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts &#xA;or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its &#xA;distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The &#xA;obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating &#xA;to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to &#xA;qualify, &#xA;an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial &#xA;Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial &#xA;Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, &#xA;the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified &#xA;Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial &#xA;product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial &#xA;Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, &#xA;or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and &#xA;warranties are such Commercial Contributor&apos;s responsibility alone. Under &#xA;this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims &#xA;against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and &#xA;warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any &#xA;damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;5. NO WARRANTY &#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED &#xA;ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER &#xA;EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR &#xA;CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A &#xA;PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining &#xA;the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all &#xA;risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, &#xA;including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, &#xA;compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or &#xA;equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY &#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY &#xA;CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, &#xA;SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION &#xA;LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN &#xA;CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) &#xA;ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE &#xA;EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE &#xA;POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;7. GENERAL &#xA;&#xA;If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under &#xA;applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of &#xA;the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action &#xA;by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum &#xA;extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with &#xA;respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or &#xA;counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that &#xA;Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as &#xA;of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient &#xA;institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim &#xA;or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding &#xA;combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes &#xA;such Recipient&apos;s patent(s), then such Recipient&apos;s rights granted under &#xA;Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;All Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails &#xA;to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement &#xA;and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after &#xA;becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient&apos;s rights under this &#xA;Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the &#xA;Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient&apos;s obligations &#xA;under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the &#xA;Program shall continue and survive. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, &#xA;but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may &#xA;only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves &#xA;the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement &#xA;from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right &#xA;to modify this Agreement. IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may &#xA;assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable &#xA;separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a &#xA;distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may &#xA;always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which &#xA;it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is &#xA;published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its &#xA;Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in &#xA;Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to &#xA;the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether &#xA;expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program &#xA;not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the &#xA;intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this &#xA;Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year &#xA;after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury &#xA;trial in any resulting litigation. &#xA;&#xA;'/>

ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE &#xA;PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT&apos;S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;1. DEFINITIONS &#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contribution&quot; means: &#xA;&#xA;a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and &#xA;documentation distributed under this Agreement, and&#xA;&#xA;b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:&#xA;&#xA;i) changes to the Program, and&#xA;&#xA;ii) additions to the Program;&#xA;&#xA;where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are &#xA;distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution &apos;originates&apos; &#xA;from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor &#xA;itself or anyone acting on such Contributor&apos;s behalf. Contributions do not &#xA;include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of &#xA;software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own &#xA;license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program. &#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contributor&quot; means any person or entity that distributes the Program. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Licensed Patents &quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which &#xA;are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or &#xA;when combined with the Program. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Program&quot; means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this &#xA;Agreement. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, &#xA;including all Contributors. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;2. GRANT OF RIGHTS &#xA;&#xA;a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants &#xA;Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to &#xA;reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly &#xA;perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, &#xA;if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.&#xA;&#xA;b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants &#xA;Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under &#xA;Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise &#xA;transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and &#xA;object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the &#xA;Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by &#xA;the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination &#xA;to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply &#xA;to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se &#xA;is licensed hereunder. &#xA;&#xA;c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses &#xA;to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any &#xA;Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other &#xA;intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims &#xA;any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on &#xA;infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to &#xA;exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby &#xA;assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights &#xA;needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to &#xA;allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient&apos;s responsibility &#xA;to acquire that license before distributing the Program.&#xA;&#xA;d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient &#xA;copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license &#xA;set forth in this Agreement.&#xA;&#xA;3. REQUIREMENTS &#xA;&#xA;A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under &#xA;its own license agreement, provided that: &#xA;&#xA;a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and&#xA;&#xA;b) its license agreement:&#xA;&#xA;i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and &#xA;conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title &#xA;and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability &#xA;and fitness for a particular purpose; &#xA;&#xA;ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for &#xA;damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential &#xA;damages, such as lost profits; &#xA;&#xA;iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered &#xA;by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and&#xA;&#xA;iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such &#xA;Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on &#xA;or through a medium customarily used for software exchange. &#xA;&#xA;When the Program is made available in source code form: &#xA;&#xA;a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and &#xA;&#xA;b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program. &#xA;&#xA;Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within &#xA;the Program. &#xA;&#xA;Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its &#xA;Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent &#xA;Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution. &#xA;&#xA;4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION &#xA;&#xA;Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities &#xA;with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this &#xA;license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the &#xA;Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering &#xA;should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for &#xA;other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a &#xA;commercial product offering, such Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;) &#xA;hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (&quot;Indemnified &#xA;Contributor&quot;) against any losses, damages and costs (collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) &#xA;arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third &#xA;party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts &#xA;or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its &#xA;distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The &#xA;obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating &#xA;to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to &#xA;qualify, &#xA;an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial &#xA;Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial &#xA;Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, &#xA;the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified &#xA;Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial &#xA;product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial &#xA;Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, &#xA;or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and &#xA;warranties are such Commercial Contributor&apos;s responsibility alone. Under &#xA;this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims &#xA;against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and &#xA;warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any &#xA;damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;5. NO WARRANTY &#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED &#xA;ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER &#xA;EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR &#xA;CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A &#xA;PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining &#xA;the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all &#xA;risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, &#xA;including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, &#xA;compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or &#xA;equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY &#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY &#xA;CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, &#xA;SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION &#xA;LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN &#xA;CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) &#xA;ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE &#xA;EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE &#xA;POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;7. GENERAL &#xA;&#xA;If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under &#xA;applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of &#xA;the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action &#xA;by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum &#xA;extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with &#xA;respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or &#xA;counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that &#xA;Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as &#xA;of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient &#xA;institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim &#xA;or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding &#xA;combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes &#xA;such Recipient&apos;s patent(s), then such Recipient&apos;s rights granted under &#xA;Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;All Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails &#xA;to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement &#xA;and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after &#xA;becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient&apos;s rights under this &#xA;Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the &#xA;Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient&apos;s obligations &#xA;under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the &#xA;Program shall continue and survive. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, &#xA;but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may &#xA;only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves &#xA;the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement &#xA;from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right &#xA;to modify this Agreement. IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may &#xA;assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable &#xA;separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a &#xA;distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may &#xA;always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which &#xA;it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is &#xA;published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its &#xA;Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in &#xA;Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to &#xA;the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether &#xA;expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program &#xA;not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the &#xA;intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this &#xA;Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year &#xA;after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury &#xA;trial in any resulting litigation. &#xA;'/>

Distribution Obligations.&#xA;&#xA;3.1. Availability of Source Code.&#xA;&#xA;Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available&#xA;in Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form and&#xA;that Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms of this&#xA;License. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of&#xA;the Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or&#xA;otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any such&#xA;Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can obtain such&#xA;Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or&#xA;through a medium customarily used for software exchange.&#xA;&#xA;3.2. Modifications.&#xA;&#xA;The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are&#xA;governed by the terms of this License. You represent that You believe&#xA;Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You have&#xA;sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.&#xA;&#xA;3.3. Required Notices.  You must include a notice in each of Your&#xA;Modifications that identifies You as the Contributor of the&#xA;Modification. You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or&#xA;trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, or any&#xA;notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving attribution to any&#xA;Contributor or the Initial Developer.&#xA;&#xA;3.4. Application of Additional Terms.  You may not offer or impose any&#xA;terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form that alters or&#xA;restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients&#xA;rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,&#xA;warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more&#xA;recipients of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your&#xA;own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any&#xA;Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty,&#xA;support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone,&#xA;and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every&#xA;Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or&#xA;such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or&#xA;liability terms You offer.&#xA;&#xA;3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.  You may distribute the&#xA;Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms of this&#xA;License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may&#xA;contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in&#xA;compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the&#xA;Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients&#xA;rights in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this&#xA;License. If You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form&#xA;under a different license, You must make it absolutely clear that any&#xA;terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by&#xA;the Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify&#xA;the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred&#xA;by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such&#xA;terms You offer.&#xA;&#xA;3.6. Larger Works.  You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered&#xA;Software with other code not governed by the terms of this License and&#xA;distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You&#xA;must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the&#xA;Covered Software.&#xA;&#xA;4. Versions of the License.&#xA;&#xA;4.1. New Versions.  Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license&#xA;steward and may publish revised and/or new versions of this License&#xA;from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version&#xA;number. Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than the&#xA;license steward has the right to modify this License.&#xA;&#xA;4.2. Effect of New Versions.&#xA;&#xA;You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the&#xA;Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the&#xA;License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If&#xA;the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software&#xA;prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available&#xA;under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and&#xA;make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of&#xA;the License under which You originally received the Covered&#xA;Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or&#xA;otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any&#xA;subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.&#xA;4.3. Modified Versions.&#xA;&#xA;When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license&#xA;for Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version&#xA;of this License if You: (a)Ã¡rename the license and remove any&#xA;references to the name of the license steward (except to note that the&#xA;license differs from this License); and (b)Ã¡otherwise make it clear&#xA;that the license contains terms which differ from this License.&#xA;&#xA;5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.&#xA;&#xA;COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN AS IS BASIS,&#xA;WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,&#xA;WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF&#xA;DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR&#xA;NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF&#xA;THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE&#xA;DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER&#xA;CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR&#xA;CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART&#xA;OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED&#xA;HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.&#xA;&#xA;6. TERMINATION.&#xA;&#xA;6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate&#xA;automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to&#xA;cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the&#xA;breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect&#xA;beyond the termination of this License shall survive.&#xA;&#xA;6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory&#xA;judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the&#xA;Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such&#xA;claim is referred to as Participant) alleging that the&#xA;Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the&#xA;Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the&#xA;Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly&#xA;infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or&#xA;indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if&#xA;the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all&#xA;Contributors under SectionsÃ¡2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall,&#xA;upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and&#xA;automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice period,&#xA;unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with&#xA;respect to the Participant Software against such Participant&#xA;either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with&#xA;Participant.&#xA;&#xA;6.3. In the event of termination under SectionsÃ¡6.1 or 6.2 above, all&#xA;end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any&#xA;distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses&#xA;granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.&#xA;&#xA;7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.&#xA;&#xA;UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT&#xA;(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL&#xA;DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED&#xA;SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY&#xA;PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES&#xA;OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST&#xA;PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR&#xA;MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN&#xA;IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH&#xA;DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR&#xA;DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTYS NEGLIGENCE TO THE&#xA;EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO&#xA;NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL&#xA;DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.&#xA;&#xA;8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.&#xA;&#xA;The Covered Software is a commercial item, as that term is defined in&#xA;48Ã¡C.F.R.Ã¡2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of commercial computer&#xA;software (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. Ã¡252.227-7014(a)(1))&#xA;and commercial computer software documentation as such terms are used&#xA;in 48Ã¡C.F.R.Ã¡12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and&#xA;48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all&#xA;U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only those&#xA;rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu&#xA;of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision&#xA;that addresses Government rights in computer software under this&#xA;License.&#xA;&#xA;9. MISCELLANEOUS.&#xA;&#xA;This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject&#xA;matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be&#xA;unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent&#xA;necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by&#xA;the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within the&#xA;Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any,&#xA;provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdictions conflict-of-law&#xA;provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject&#xA;to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and&#xA;venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software,&#xA;with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without&#xA;limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and&#xA;expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on&#xA;Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly&#xA;excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a&#xA;contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to&#xA;this License. You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance&#xA;with the United States export administration regulations (and the&#xA;export control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You&#xA;use, distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.&#xA;&#xA;10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.&#xA;&#xA;As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is&#xA;responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,&#xA;out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to&#xA;work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such&#xA;responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or&#xA;shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.&#xA;&#xA;NOTICE PURSUANT TO SECTION 9 OF THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND&#xA;DISTRIBUTION LICENSE (CDDL) The GlassFish code released under the CDDL&#xA;shall be governed by the laws of the State of California (excluding&#xA;conflict-of-law provisions). Any litigation relating to this License&#xA;shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the&#xA;Northern District of California and the state courts of the State of&#xA;California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California.&#xA;&#xA;For plexus-archiver-1.0-alpha-7.jar:&#xA;&#xA;=========================================================================&#xA;==  Plexus License                                                     ==&#xA;=========================================================================&#xA;&#xA;Common Public License - v 1.0 &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON &#xA;PUBLIC LICENSE (&quot;AGREEMENT&quot;). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE &#xA;PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT&apos;S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;1. DEFINITIONS &#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contribution&quot; means: &#xA;&#xA;a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and &#xA;documentation distributed under this Agreement, and&#xA;&#xA;b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:&#xA;&#xA;i) changes to the Program, and&#xA;&#xA;ii) additions to the Program;&#xA;&#xA;where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are &#xA;distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution &apos;originates&apos; &#xA;from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor &#xA;itself or anyone acting on such Contributor&apos;s behalf. Contributions do not &#xA;include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of &#xA;software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own &#xA;license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program. &#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contributor&quot; means any person or entity that distributes the Program. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Licensed Patents &quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which &#xA;are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or &#xA;when combined with the Program. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Program&quot; means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this &#xA;Agreement. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, &#xA;including all Contributors. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;2. GRANT OF RIGHTS &#xA;&#xA;a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants &#xA;Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to &#xA;reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly &#xA;perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, &#xA;if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.&#xA;&#xA;b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants &#xA;Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under &#xA;Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise &#xA;transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and &#xA;object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the &#xA;Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by &#xA;the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination &#xA;to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply &#xA;to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se &#xA;is licensed hereunder. &#xA;&#xA;c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses &#xA;to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any &#xA;Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other &#xA;intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims &#xA;any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on &#xA;infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to &#xA;exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby &#xA;assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights &#xA;needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to &#xA;allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient&apos;s responsibility &#xA;to acquire that license before distributing the Program.&#xA;&#xA;d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient &#xA;copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license &#xA;set forth in this Agreement.&#xA;&#xA;3. REQUIREMENTS &#xA;&#xA;A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under &#xA;its own license agreement, provided that: &#xA;&#xA;a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and&#xA;&#xA;b) its license agreement:&#xA;&#xA;i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and &#xA;conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title &#xA;and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability &#xA;and fitness for a particular purpose; &#xA;&#xA;ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for &#xA;damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential &#xA;damages, such as lost profits; &#xA;&#xA;iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered &#xA;by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and&#xA;&#xA;iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such &#xA;Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on &#xA;or through a medium customarily used for software exchange. &#xA;&#xA;When the Program is made available in source code form: &#xA;&#xA;a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and &#xA;&#xA;b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program. &#xA;&#xA;Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within &#xA;the Program. &#xA;&#xA;Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its &#xA;Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent &#xA;Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution. &#xA;&#xA;4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION &#xA;&#xA;Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities &#xA;with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this &#xA;license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the &#xA;Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering &#xA;should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for &#xA;other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a &#xA;commercial product offering, such Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;) &#xA;hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (&quot;Indemnified &#xA;Contributor&quot;) against any losses, damages and costs (collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) &#xA;arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third &#xA;party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts &#xA;or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its &#xA;distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The &#xA;obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating &#xA;to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to &#xA;qualify, &#xA;an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial &#xA;Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial &#xA;Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, &#xA;the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified &#xA;Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial &#xA;product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial &#xA;Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, &#xA;or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and &#xA;warranties are such Commercial Contributor&apos;s responsibility alone. Under &#xA;this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims &#xA;against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and &#xA;warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any &#xA;damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;5. NO WARRANTY &#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED &#xA;ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER &#xA;EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR &#xA;CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A &#xA;PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining &#xA;the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all &#xA;risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, &#xA;including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, &#xA;compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or &#xA;equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY &#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY &#xA;CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, &#xA;SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION &#xA;LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN &#xA;CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) &#xA;ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE &#xA;EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE &#xA;POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;7. GENERAL &#xA;&#xA;If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under &#xA;applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of &#xA;the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action &#xA;by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum &#xA;extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with &#xA;respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or &#xA;counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that &#xA;Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as &#xA;of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient &#xA;institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim &#xA;or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding &#xA;combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes &#xA;such Recipient&apos;s patent(s), then such Recipient&apos;s rights granted under &#xA;Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;All Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails &#xA;to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement &#xA;and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after &#xA;becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient&apos;s rights under this &#xA;Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the &#xA;Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient&apos;s obligations &#xA;under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the &#xA;Program shall continue and survive. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, &#xA;but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may &#xA;only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves &#xA;the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement &#xA;from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right &#xA;to modify this Agreement. IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may &#xA;assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable &#xA;separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a &#xA;distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may &#xA;always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which &#xA;it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is &#xA;published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its &#xA;Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in &#xA;Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to &#xA;the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether &#xA;expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program &#xA;not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the &#xA;intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this &#xA;Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year &#xA;after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury &#xA;trial in any resulting litigation. &#xA;&#xA;'/>

Application of Additional Terms.  You may not offer or impose any&#xA;terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form that alters or&#xA;restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients&#xA;rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,&#xA;warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more&#xA;recipients of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your&#xA;own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any&#xA;Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty,&#xA;support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone,&#xA;and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every&#xA;Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or&#xA;such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or&#xA;liability terms You offer.&#xA;&#xA;3.5.

You may distribute the&#xA;Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms of this&#xA;License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may&#xA;contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in&#xA;compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the&#xA;Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients&#xA;rights in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this&#xA;License. If You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form&#xA;under a different license, You must make it absolutely clear that any&#xA;terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by&#xA;the Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify&#xA;the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred&#xA;by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such&#xA;terms You offer.&#xA;&#xA;3.6.

Each version will be given a distinguishing version&#xA;number. Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than the&#xA;license steward has the right to modify this License.&#xA;&#xA;4.2. Effect of New Versions.&#xA;&#xA;You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the&#xA;Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the&#xA;License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If&#xA;the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software&#xA;prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available&#xA;under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and&#xA;make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of&#xA;the License under which You originally received the Covered&#xA;Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or&#xA;otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any&#xA;subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.&#xA;4.3. Modified Versions.&#xA;&#xA;When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license&#xA;for Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version&#xA;of this License if You: (a)Ã¡rename the license and remove any&#xA;references to the name of the license steward (except to note that the&#xA;license differs from this License); and (b)Ã¡otherwise make it clear&#xA;that the license contains terms which differ from this License.&#xA;&#xA;5.

Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect&#xA;beyond the termination of this License shall survive.&#xA;&#xA;6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory&#xA;judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the&#xA;Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such&#xA;claim is referred to as Participant) alleging that the&#xA;Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the&#xA;Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the&#xA;Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly&#xA;infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or&#xA;indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if&#xA;the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all&#xA;Contributors under SectionsÃ¡2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall,&#xA;upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and&#xA;automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice period,&#xA;unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with&#xA;respect to the Participant Software against such Participant&#xA;either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with&#xA;Participant.&#xA;&#xA;6.3.

THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR&#xA;DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTYS NEGLIGENCE TO THE&#xA;EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO&#xA;NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL&#xA;DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.&#xA;&#xA;8.

RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.&#xA;&#xA;As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is&#xA;responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,&#xA;out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to&#xA;work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such&#xA;responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or&#xA;shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.&#xA;&#xA;NOTICE PURSUANT TO SECTION 9 OF THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND&#xA;DISTRIBUTION LICENSE (CDDL) The GlassFish code released under the CDDL&#xA;shall be governed by the laws of the State of California (excluding&#xA;conflict-of-law provisions). Any litigation relating to this License&#xA;shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the&#xA;Northern District of California and the state courts of the State of&#xA;California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California.&#xA;&#xA;For plexus-archiver jar:&#xA;&#xA;=========================================================================&#xA;==  Plexus License                                                     ==&#xA;=========================================================================&#xA;&#xA;Common Public License - v 1.0 &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON &#xA;PUBLIC LICENSE (&quot;AGREEMENT&quot;). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE &#xA;PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT&apos;S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;1. DEFINITIONS &#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contribution&quot; means: &#xA;&#xA;a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and &#xA;documentation distributed under this Agreement, and&#xA;&#xA;b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:&#xA;&#xA;i) changes to the Program, and&#xA;&#xA;ii) additions to the Program;&#xA;&#xA;where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are &#xA;distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution &apos;originates&apos; &#xA;from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor &#xA;itself or anyone acting on such Contributor&apos;s behalf. Contributions do not &#xA;include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of &#xA;software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own &#xA;license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program. &#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contributor&quot; means any person or entity that distributes the Program. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Licensed Patents &quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which &#xA;are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or &#xA;when combined with the Program. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Program&quot; means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this &#xA;Agreement. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, &#xA;including all Contributors. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;2. GRANT OF RIGHTS &#xA;&#xA;a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants &#xA;Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to &#xA;reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly &#xA;perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, &#xA;if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.&#xA;&#xA;b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants &#xA;Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under &#xA;Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise &#xA;transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and &#xA;object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the &#xA;Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by &#xA;the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination &#xA;to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply &#xA;to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se &#xA;is licensed hereunder. &#xA;&#xA;c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses &#xA;to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any &#xA;Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other &#xA;intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims &#xA;any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on &#xA;infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to &#xA;exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby &#xA;assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights &#xA;needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to &#xA;allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient&apos;s responsibility &#xA;to acquire that license before distributing the Program.&#xA;&#xA;d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient &#xA;copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license &#xA;set forth in this Agreement.&#xA;&#xA;3. REQUIREMENTS &#xA;&#xA;A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under &#xA;its own license agreement, provided that: &#xA;&#xA;a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and&#xA;&#xA;b) its license agreement:&#xA;&#xA;i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and &#xA;conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title &#xA;and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability &#xA;and fitness for a particular purpose; &#xA;&#xA;ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for &#xA;damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential &#xA;damages, such as lost profits; &#xA;&#xA;iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered &#xA;by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and&#xA;&#xA;iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such &#xA;Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on &#xA;or through a medium customarily used for software exchange. &#xA;&#xA;When the Program is made available in source code form: &#xA;&#xA;a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and &#xA;&#xA;b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program. &#xA;&#xA;Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within &#xA;the Program. &#xA;&#xA;Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its &#xA;Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent &#xA;Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution. &#xA;&#xA;4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION &#xA;&#xA;Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities &#xA;with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this &#xA;license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the &#xA;Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering &#xA;should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for &#xA;other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a &#xA;commercial product offering, such Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;) &#xA;hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (&quot;Indemnified &#xA;Contributor&quot;) against any losses, damages and costs (collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) &#xA;arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third &#xA;party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts &#xA;or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its &#xA;distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The &#xA;obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating &#xA;to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to &#xA;qualify, &#xA;an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial &#xA;Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial &#xA;Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, &#xA;the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified &#xA;Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial &#xA;product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial &#xA;Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, &#xA;or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and &#xA;warranties are such Commercial Contributor&apos;s responsibility alone. Under &#xA;this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims &#xA;against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and &#xA;warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any &#xA;damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;5. NO WARRANTY &#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED &#xA;ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER &#xA;EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR &#xA;CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A &#xA;PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining &#xA;the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all &#xA;risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, &#xA;including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, &#xA;compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or &#xA;equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY &#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY &#xA;CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, &#xA;SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION &#xA;LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN &#xA;CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) &#xA;ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE &#xA;EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE &#xA;POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;7. GENERAL &#xA;&#xA;If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under &#xA;applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of &#xA;the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action &#xA;by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum &#xA;extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with &#xA;respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or &#xA;counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that &#xA;Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as &#xA;of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient &#xA;institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim &#xA;or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding &#xA;combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes &#xA;such Recipient&apos;s patent(s), then such Recipient&apos;s rights granted under &#xA;Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;All Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails &#xA;to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement &#xA;and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after &#xA;becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient&apos;s rights under this &#xA;Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the &#xA;Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient&apos;s obligations &#xA;under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the &#xA;Program shall continue and survive. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, &#xA;but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may &#xA;only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves &#xA;the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement &#xA;from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right &#xA;to modify this Agreement. IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may &#xA;assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable &#xA;separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a &#xA;distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may &#xA;always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which &#xA;it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is &#xA;published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its &#xA;Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in &#xA;Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to &#xA;the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether &#xA;expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program &#xA;not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the &#xA;intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this &#xA;Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year &#xA;after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury &#xA;trial in any resulting litigation. &#xA;&#xA;'/>

Application of Additional Terms.  You may not offer or impose any&#xA;terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form that alters or&#xA;restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients&#xA;rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,&#xA;warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more&#xA;recipients of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your&#xA;own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any&#xA;Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty,&#xA;support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone,&#xA;and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every&#xA;Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or&#xA;such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or&#xA;liability terms You offer.&#xA;&#xA;3.5.

You may distribute the&#xA;Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms of this&#xA;License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may&#xA;contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in&#xA;compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the&#xA;Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients&#xA;rights in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this&#xA;License. If You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form&#xA;under a different license, You must make it absolutely clear that any&#xA;terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by&#xA;the Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify&#xA;the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred&#xA;by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such&#xA;terms You offer.&#xA;&#xA;3.6.

Each version will be given a distinguishing version&#xA;number. Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than the&#xA;license steward has the right to modify this License.&#xA;&#xA;4.2. Effect of New Versions.&#xA;&#xA;You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the&#xA;Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the&#xA;License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If&#xA;the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software&#xA;prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available&#xA;under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and&#xA;make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of&#xA;the License under which You originally received the Covered&#xA;Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or&#xA;otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any&#xA;subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.&#xA;4.3. Modified Versions.&#xA;&#xA;When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license&#xA;for Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version&#xA;of this License if You: (a)Ã¡rename the license and remove any&#xA;references to the name of the license steward (except to note that the&#xA;license differs from this License); and (b)Ã¡otherwise make it clear&#xA;that the license contains terms which differ from this License.&#xA;&#xA;5.

Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect&#xA;beyond the termination of this License shall survive.&#xA;&#xA;6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory&#xA;judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the&#xA;Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such&#xA;claim is referred to as Participant) alleging that the&#xA;Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the&#xA;Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the&#xA;Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly&#xA;infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or&#xA;indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if&#xA;the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all&#xA;Contributors under SectionsÃ¡2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall,&#xA;upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and&#xA;automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice period,&#xA;unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with&#xA;respect to the Participant Software against such Participant&#xA;either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with&#xA;Participant.&#xA;&#xA;6.3. In the event of termination under SectionsÃ¡6.1 or 6.2 above, all&#xA;end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any&#xA;distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses&#xA;granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.&#xA;&#xA;7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.&#xA;&#xA;UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT&#xA;(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL&#xA;DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED&#xA;SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY&#xA;PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES&#xA;OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST&#xA;PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR&#xA;MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN&#xA;IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH&#xA;DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR&#xA;DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTYS NEGLIGENCE TO THE&#xA;EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO&#xA;NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL&#xA;DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.&#xA;&#xA;8.

MISCELLANEOUS.&#xA;&#xA;This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject&#xA;matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be&#xA;unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent&#xA;necessary to make it enforceable.

RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.&#xA;&#xA;As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is&#xA;responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,&#xA;out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to&#xA;work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such&#xA;responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or&#xA;shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.&#xA;&#xA;NOTICE PURSUANT TO SECTION 9 OF THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND&#xA;DISTRIBUTION LICENSE (CDDL) The GlassFish code released under the CDDL&#xA;shall be governed by the laws of the State of California (excluding&#xA;conflict-of-law provisions). Any litigation relating to this License&#xA;shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the&#xA;Northern District of California and the state courts of the State of&#xA;California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California.&#xA;&#xA;For plexus-archiver-1.0-alpha-7.jar:&#xA;&#xA;=========================================================================&#xA;==  Plexus License                                                     ==&#xA;=========================================================================&#xA;&#xA;Common Public License - v 1.0 &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON &#xA;PUBLIC LICENSE (&quot;AGREEMENT&quot;). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE &#xA;PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT&apos;S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;1. DEFINITIONS &#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contribution&quot; means: &#xA;&#xA;a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and &#xA;documentation distributed under this Agreement, and&#xA;&#xA;b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:&#xA;&#xA;i) changes to the Program, and&#xA;&#xA;ii) additions to the Program;&#xA;&#xA;where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are &#xA;distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution &apos;originates&apos; &#xA;from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor &#xA;itself or anyone acting on such Contributor&apos;s behalf. Contributions do not &#xA;include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of &#xA;software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own &#xA;license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program. &#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contributor&quot; means any person or entity that distributes the Program. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Licensed Patents &quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which &#xA;are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or &#xA;when combined with the Program. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Program&quot; means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this &#xA;Agreement. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, &#xA;including all Contributors. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;2. GRANT OF RIGHTS &#xA;&#xA;a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants &#xA;Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to &#xA;reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly &#xA;perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, &#xA;if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.&#xA;&#xA;b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants &#xA;Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under &#xA;Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise &#xA;transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and &#xA;object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the &#xA;Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by &#xA;the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination &#xA;to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply &#xA;to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se &#xA;is licensed hereunder. &#xA;&#xA;c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses &#xA;to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any &#xA;Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other &#xA;intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims &#xA;any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on &#xA;infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to &#xA;exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby &#xA;assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights &#xA;needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to &#xA;allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient&apos;s responsibility &#xA;to acquire that license before distributing the Program.&#xA;&#xA;d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient &#xA;copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license &#xA;set forth in this Agreement.&#xA;&#xA;3. REQUIREMENTS &#xA;&#xA;A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under &#xA;its own license agreement, provided that: &#xA;&#xA;a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and&#xA;&#xA;b) its license agreement:&#xA;&#xA;i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and &#xA;conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title &#xA;and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability &#xA;and fitness for a particular purpose; &#xA;&#xA;ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for &#xA;damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential &#xA;damages, such as lost profits; &#xA;&#xA;iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered &#xA;by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and&#xA;&#xA;iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such &#xA;Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on &#xA;or through a medium customarily used for software exchange. &#xA;&#xA;When the Program is made available in source code form: &#xA;&#xA;a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and &#xA;&#xA;b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program. &#xA;&#xA;Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within &#xA;the Program. &#xA;&#xA;Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its &#xA;Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent &#xA;Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution. &#xA;&#xA;4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION &#xA;&#xA;Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities &#xA;with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this &#xA;license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the &#xA;Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering &#xA;should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for &#xA;other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a &#xA;commercial product offering, such Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;) &#xA;hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (&quot;Indemnified &#xA;Contributor&quot;) against any losses, damages and costs (collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) &#xA;arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third &#xA;party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts &#xA;or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its &#xA;distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The &#xA;obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating &#xA;to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to &#xA;qualify, &#xA;an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial &#xA;Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial &#xA;Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, &#xA;the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified &#xA;Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial &#xA;product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial &#xA;Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, &#xA;or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and &#xA;warranties are such Commercial Contributor&apos;s responsibility alone. Under &#xA;this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims &#xA;against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and &#xA;warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any &#xA;damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;5. NO WARRANTY &#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED &#xA;ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER &#xA;EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR &#xA;CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A &#xA;PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining &#xA;the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all &#xA;risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, &#xA;including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, &#xA;compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or &#xA;equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY &#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY &#xA;CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, &#xA;SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION &#xA;LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN &#xA;CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) &#xA;ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE &#xA;EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE &#xA;POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;7. GENERAL &#xA;&#xA;If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under &#xA;applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of &#xA;the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action &#xA;by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum &#xA;extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with &#xA;respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or &#xA;counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that &#xA;Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as &#xA;of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient &#xA;institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim &#xA;or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding &#xA;combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes &#xA;such Recipient&apos;s patent(s), then such Recipient&apos;s rights granted under &#xA;Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;All Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails &#xA;to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement &#xA;and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after &#xA;becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient&apos;s rights under this &#xA;Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the &#xA;Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient&apos;s obligations &#xA;under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the &#xA;Program shall continue and survive. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, &#xA;but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may &#xA;only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves &#xA;the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement &#xA;from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right &#xA;to modify this Agreement. IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may &#xA;assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable &#xA;separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a &#xA;distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may &#xA;always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which &#xA;it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is &#xA;published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its &#xA;Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in &#xA;Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to &#xA;the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether &#xA;expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program &#xA;not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the &#xA;intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this &#xA;Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year &#xA;after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury &#xA;trial in any resulting litigation. &#xA;&#xA;'/>

Distribution Obligations.&#xA;&#xA;3.1. Availability of Source Code.&#xA;&#xA;Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available&#xA;in Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form and&#xA;that Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms of this&#xA;License. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of&#xA;the Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or&#xA;otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any such&#xA;Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can obtain such&#xA;Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or&#xA;through a medium customarily used for software exchange.&#xA;&#xA;3.2. Modifications.&#xA;&#xA;The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are&#xA;governed by the terms of this License. You represent that You believe&#xA;Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You have&#xA;sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.&#xA;&#xA;3.3. Required Notices.  You must include a notice in each of Your&#xA;Modifications that identifies You as the Contributor of the&#xA;Modification. You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or&#xA;trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, or any&#xA;notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving attribution to any&#xA;Contributor or the Initial Developer.&#xA;&#xA;3.4. Application of Additional Terms.  You may not offer or impose any&#xA;terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form that alters or&#xA;restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients&#xA;rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,&#xA;warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more&#xA;recipients of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your&#xA;own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any&#xA;Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty,&#xA;support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone,&#xA;and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every&#xA;Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or&#xA;such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or&#xA;liability terms You offer.&#xA;&#xA;3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.  You may distribute the&#xA;Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms of this&#xA;License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may&#xA;contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in&#xA;compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the&#xA;Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients&#xA;rights in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this&#xA;License. If You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form&#xA;under a different license, You must make it absolutely clear that any&#xA;terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by&#xA;the Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify&#xA;the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred&#xA;by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such&#xA;terms You offer.&#xA;&#xA;3.6. Larger Works.  You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered&#xA;Software with other code not governed by the terms of this License and&#xA;distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You&#xA;must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the&#xA;Covered Software.&#xA;&#xA;4. Versions of the License.&#xA;&#xA;4.1. New Versions.  Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license&#xA;steward and may publish revised and/or new versions of this License&#xA;from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version&#xA;number. Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than the&#xA;license steward has the right to modify this License.&#xA;&#xA;4.2. Effect of New Versions.&#xA;&#xA;You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the&#xA;Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the&#xA;License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If&#xA;the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software&#xA;prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available&#xA;under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and&#xA;make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of&#xA;the License under which You originally received the Covered&#xA;Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or&#xA;otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any&#xA;subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.&#xA;4.3. Modified Versions.&#xA;&#xA;When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license&#xA;for Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version&#xA;of this License if You: (a)Ã¡rename the license and remove any&#xA;references to the name of the license steward (except to note that the&#xA;license differs from this License); and (b)Ã¡otherwise make it clear&#xA;that the license contains terms which differ from this License.&#xA;&#xA;5.

Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect&#xA;beyond the termination of this License shall survive.&#xA;&#xA;6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory&#xA;judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the&#xA;Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such&#xA;claim is referred to as Participant) alleging that the&#xA;Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the&#xA;Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the&#xA;Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly&#xA;infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or&#xA;indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if&#xA;the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all&#xA;Contributors under SectionsÃ¡2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall,&#xA;upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and&#xA;automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice period,&#xA;unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with&#xA;respect to the Participant Software against such Participant&#xA;either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with&#xA;Participant.&#xA;&#xA;6.3. In the event of termination under SectionsÃ¡6.1 or 6.2 above, all&#xA;end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any&#xA;distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses&#xA;granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.&#xA;&#xA;7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.&#xA;&#xA;UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT&#xA;(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL&#xA;DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED&#xA;SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY&#xA;PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES&#xA;OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST&#xA;PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR&#xA;MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN&#xA;IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH&#xA;DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR&#xA;DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTYS NEGLIGENCE TO THE&#xA;EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION.

A Contribution &apos;originates&apos; &#xA;from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor &#xA;itself or anyone acting on such Contributor&apos;s behalf. Contributions do not &#xA;include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of &#xA;software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own &#xA;license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program. &#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contributor&quot; means any person or entity that distributes the Program. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Licensed Patents &quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which &#xA;are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or &#xA;when combined with the Program. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Program&quot; means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this &#xA;Agreement. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, &#xA;including all Contributors. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;2. GRANT OF RIGHTS &#xA;&#xA;a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants &#xA;Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to &#xA;reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly &#xA;perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, &#xA;if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.&#xA;&#xA;b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants &#xA;Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under &#xA;Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise &#xA;transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and &#xA;object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the &#xA;Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by &#xA;the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination &#xA;to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply &#xA;to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se &#xA;is licensed hereunder. &#xA;&#xA;c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses &#xA;to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any &#xA;Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other &#xA;intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims &#xA;any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on &#xA;infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to &#xA;exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby &#xA;assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights &#xA;needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to &#xA;allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient&apos;s responsibility &#xA;to acquire that license before distributing the Program.&#xA;&#xA;d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient &#xA;copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license &#xA;set forth in this Agreement.&#xA;&#xA;3. REQUIREMENTS &#xA;&#xA;A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under &#xA;its own license agreement, provided that: &#xA;&#xA;a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and&#xA;&#xA;b) its license agreement:&#xA;&#xA;i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and &#xA;conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title &#xA;and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability &#xA;and fitness for a particular purpose; &#xA;&#xA;ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for &#xA;damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential &#xA;damages, such as lost profits; &#xA;&#xA;iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered &#xA;by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and&#xA;&#xA;iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such &#xA;Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on &#xA;or through a medium customarily used for software exchange. &#xA;&#xA;When the Program is made available in source code form: &#xA;&#xA;a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and &#xA;&#xA;b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program. &#xA;&#xA;Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within &#xA;the Program. &#xA;&#xA;Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its &#xA;Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent &#xA;Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution. &#xA;&#xA;4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION &#xA;&#xA;Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities &#xA;with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this &#xA;license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the &#xA;Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering &#xA;should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for &#xA;other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a &#xA;commercial product offering, such Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;) &#xA;hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (&quot;Indemnified &#xA;Contributor&quot;) against any losses, damages and costs (collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) &#xA;arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third &#xA;party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts &#xA;or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its &#xA;distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The &#xA;obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating &#xA;to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to &#xA;qualify, &#xA;an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial &#xA;Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial &#xA;Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, &#xA;the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified &#xA;Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial &#xA;product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial &#xA;Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, &#xA;or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and &#xA;warranties are such Commercial Contributor&apos;s responsibility alone. Under &#xA;this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims &#xA;against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and &#xA;warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any &#xA;damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;5. NO WARRANTY &#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED &#xA;ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER &#xA;EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR &#xA;CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A &#xA;PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining &#xA;the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all &#xA;risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, &#xA;including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, &#xA;compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or &#xA;equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY &#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY &#xA;CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, &#xA;SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION &#xA;LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN &#xA;CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) &#xA;ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE &#xA;EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE &#xA;POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;7. GENERAL &#xA;&#xA;If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under &#xA;applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of &#xA;the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action &#xA;by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum &#xA;extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with &#xA;respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or &#xA;counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that &#xA;Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as &#xA;of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient &#xA;institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim &#xA;or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding &#xA;combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes &#xA;such Recipient&apos;s patent(s), then such Recipient&apos;s rights granted under &#xA;Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;All Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails &#xA;to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement &#xA;and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after &#xA;becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient&apos;s rights under this &#xA;Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the &#xA;Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient&apos;s obligations &#xA;under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the &#xA;Program shall continue and survive. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, &#xA;but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may &#xA;only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves &#xA;the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement &#xA;from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right &#xA;to modify this Agreement. IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may &#xA;assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable &#xA;separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a &#xA;distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may &#xA;always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which &#xA;it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is &#xA;published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its &#xA;Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in &#xA;Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to &#xA;the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether &#xA;expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program &#xA;not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the &#xA;intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this &#xA;Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year &#xA;after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury &#xA;trial in any resulting litigation. &#xA;&#xA;'/>

Distribution Obligations.&#xA;&#xA;3.1. Availability of Source Code.&#xA;&#xA;Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available&#xA;in Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form and&#xA;that Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms of this&#xA;License. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of&#xA;the Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or&#xA;otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any such&#xA;Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can obtain such&#xA;Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or&#xA;through a medium customarily used for software exchange.&#xA;&#xA;3.2. Modifications.&#xA;&#xA;The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are&#xA;governed by the terms of this License. You represent that You believe&#xA;Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You have&#xA;sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.&#xA;&#xA;3.3. Required Notices.  You must include a notice in each of Your&#xA;Modifications that identifies You as the Contributor of the&#xA;Modification. You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or&#xA;trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, or any&#xA;notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving attribution to any&#xA;Contributor or the Initial Developer.&#xA;&#xA;3.4. Application of Additional Terms.  You may not offer or impose any&#xA;terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form that alters or&#xA;restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients&#xA;rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,&#xA;warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more&#xA;recipients of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your&#xA;own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any&#xA;Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty,&#xA;support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone,&#xA;and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every&#xA;Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or&#xA;such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or&#xA;liability terms You offer.&#xA;&#xA;3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.  You may distribute the&#xA;Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms of this&#xA;License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may&#xA;contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in&#xA;compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the&#xA;Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients&#xA;rights in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this&#xA;License. If You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form&#xA;under a different license, You must make it absolutely clear that any&#xA;terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by&#xA;the Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify&#xA;the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred&#xA;by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such&#xA;terms You offer.&#xA;&#xA;3.6. Larger Works.  You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered&#xA;Software with other code not governed by the terms of this License and&#xA;distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You&#xA;must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the&#xA;Covered Software.&#xA;&#xA;4. Versions of the License.&#xA;&#xA;4.1. New Versions.  Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license&#xA;steward and may publish revised and/or new versions of this License&#xA;from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version&#xA;number. Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than the&#xA;license steward has the right to modify this License.&#xA;&#xA;4.2. Effect of New Versions.&#xA;&#xA;You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the&#xA;Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the&#xA;License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If&#xA;the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software&#xA;prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available&#xA;under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and&#xA;make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of&#xA;the License under which You originally received the Covered&#xA;Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or&#xA;otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any&#xA;subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.&#xA;4.3. Modified Versions.&#xA;&#xA;When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license&#xA;for Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version&#xA;of this License if You: (a)Ã¡rename the license and remove any&#xA;references to the name of the license steward (except to note that the&#xA;license differs from this License); and (b)Ã¡otherwise make it clear&#xA;that the license contains terms which differ from this License.&#xA;&#xA;5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.&#xA;&#xA;COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN AS IS BASIS,&#xA;WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,&#xA;WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF&#xA;DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR&#xA;NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF&#xA;THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU.

THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART&#xA;OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED&#xA;HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.&#xA;&#xA;6. TERMINATION.&#xA;&#xA;6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate&#xA;automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to&#xA;cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the&#xA;breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect&#xA;beyond the termination of this License shall survive.&#xA;&#xA;6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory&#xA;judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the&#xA;Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such&#xA;claim is referred to as Participant) alleging that the&#xA;Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the&#xA;Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the&#xA;Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly&#xA;infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or&#xA;indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if&#xA;the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all&#xA;Contributors under SectionsÃ¡2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall,&#xA;upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and&#xA;automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice period,&#xA;unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with&#xA;respect to the Participant Software against such Participant&#xA;either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with&#xA;Participant.&#xA;&#xA;6.3. In the event of termination under SectionsÃ¡6.1 or 6.2 above, all&#xA;end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any&#xA;distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses&#xA;granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.&#xA;&#xA;7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.&#xA;&#xA;UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT&#xA;(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL&#xA;DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED&#xA;SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY&#xA;PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES&#xA;OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST&#xA;PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR&#xA;MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN&#xA;IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH&#xA;DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR&#xA;DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTYS NEGLIGENCE TO THE&#xA;EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO&#xA;NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL&#xA;DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.&#xA;&#xA;8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.&#xA;&#xA;The Covered Software is a commercial item, as that term is defined in&#xA;48Ã¡C.F.R.Ã¡2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of commercial computer&#xA;software (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. Ã¡252.227-7014(a)(1))&#xA;and commercial computer software documentation as such terms are used&#xA;in 48Ã¡C.F.R.Ã¡12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and&#xA;48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all&#xA;U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only those&#xA;rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu&#xA;of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision&#xA;that addresses Government rights in computer software under this&#xA;License.&#xA;&#xA;9. MISCELLANEOUS.&#xA;&#xA;This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject&#xA;matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be&#xA;unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent&#xA;necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by&#xA;the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within the&#xA;Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any,&#xA;provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdictions conflict-of-law&#xA;provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject&#xA;to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and&#xA;venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software,&#xA;with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without&#xA;limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and&#xA;expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on&#xA;Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly&#xA;excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a&#xA;contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to&#xA;this License. You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance&#xA;with the United States export administration regulations (and the&#xA;export control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You&#xA;use, distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.&#xA;&#xA;10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.&#xA;&#xA;As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is&#xA;responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,&#xA;out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to&#xA;work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such&#xA;responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or&#xA;shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.&#xA;&#xA;NOTICE PURSUANT TO SECTION 9 OF THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND&#xA;DISTRIBUTION LICENSE (CDDL) The GlassFish code released under the CDDL&#xA;shall be governed by the laws of the State of California (excluding&#xA;conflict-of-law provisions). Any litigation relating to this License&#xA;shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the&#xA;Northern District of California and the state courts of the State of&#xA;California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California.&#xA;&#xA;For plexus-archiver-1.0-alpha-7.jar:&#xA;&#xA;=========================================================================&#xA;==  Plexus License                                                     ==&#xA;=========================================================================&#xA;&#xA;Common Public License - v 1.0 &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON &#xA;PUBLIC LICENSE (&quot;AGREEMENT&quot;). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE &#xA;PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT&apos;S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;1. DEFINITIONS &#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contribution&quot; means: &#xA;&#xA;a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and &#xA;documentation distributed under this Agreement, and&#xA;&#xA;b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:&#xA;&#xA;i) changes to the Program, and&#xA;&#xA;ii) additions to the Program;&#xA;&#xA;where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are &#xA;distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution &apos;originates&apos; &#xA;from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor &#xA;itself or anyone acting on such Contributor&apos;s behalf. Contributions do not &#xA;include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of &#xA;software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own &#xA;license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program. &#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contributor&quot; means any person or entity that distributes the Program. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Licensed Patents &quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which &#xA;are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or &#xA;when combined with the Program. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Program&quot; means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this &#xA;Agreement. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, &#xA;including all Contributors. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;2. GRANT OF RIGHTS &#xA;&#xA;a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants &#xA;Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to &#xA;reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly &#xA;perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, &#xA;if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.&#xA;&#xA;b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants &#xA;Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under &#xA;Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise &#xA;transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and &#xA;object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the &#xA;Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by &#xA;the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination &#xA;to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply &#xA;to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se &#xA;is licensed hereunder. &#xA;&#xA;c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses &#xA;to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any &#xA;Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other &#xA;intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims &#xA;any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on &#xA;infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to &#xA;exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby &#xA;assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights &#xA;needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to &#xA;allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient&apos;s responsibility &#xA;to acquire that license before distributing the Program.&#xA;&#xA;d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient &#xA;copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license &#xA;set forth in this Agreement.&#xA;&#xA;3. REQUIREMENTS &#xA;&#xA;A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under &#xA;its own license agreement, provided that: &#xA;&#xA;a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and&#xA;&#xA;b) its license agreement:&#xA;&#xA;i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and &#xA;conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title &#xA;and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability &#xA;and fitness for a particular purpose; &#xA;&#xA;ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for &#xA;damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential &#xA;damages, such as lost profits; &#xA;&#xA;iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered &#xA;by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and&#xA;&#xA;iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such &#xA;Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on &#xA;or through a medium customarily used for software exchange. &#xA;&#xA;When the Program is made available in source code form: &#xA;&#xA;a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and &#xA;&#xA;b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program. &#xA;&#xA;Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within &#xA;the Program. &#xA;&#xA;Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its &#xA;Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent &#xA;Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution. &#xA;&#xA;4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION &#xA;&#xA;Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities &#xA;with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this &#xA;license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the &#xA;Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering &#xA;should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for &#xA;other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a &#xA;commercial product offering, such Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;) &#xA;hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (&quot;Indemnified &#xA;Contributor&quot;) against any losses, damages and costs (collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) &#xA;arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third &#xA;party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts &#xA;or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its &#xA;distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The &#xA;obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating &#xA;to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to &#xA;qualify, &#xA;an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial &#xA;Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial &#xA;Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, &#xA;the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified &#xA;Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial &#xA;product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial &#xA;Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, &#xA;or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and &#xA;warranties are such Commercial Contributor&apos;s responsibility alone. Under &#xA;this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims &#xA;against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and &#xA;warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any &#xA;damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;5. NO WARRANTY &#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED &#xA;ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER &#xA;EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR &#xA;CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A &#xA;PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining &#xA;the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all &#xA;risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, &#xA;including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, &#xA;compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or &#xA;equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY &#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY &#xA;CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, &#xA;SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION &#xA;LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN &#xA;CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) &#xA;ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE &#xA;EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE &#xA;POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;7. GENERAL &#xA;&#xA;If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under &#xA;applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of &#xA;the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action &#xA;by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum &#xA;extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with &#xA;respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or &#xA;counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that &#xA;Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as &#xA;of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient &#xA;institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim &#xA;or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding &#xA;combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes &#xA;such Recipient&apos;s patent(s), then such Recipient&apos;s rights granted under &#xA;Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;All Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails &#xA;to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement &#xA;and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after &#xA;becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient&apos;s rights under this &#xA;Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the &#xA;Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient&apos;s obligations &#xA;under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the &#xA;Program shall continue and survive. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, &#xA;but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may &#xA;only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves &#xA;the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement &#xA;from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right &#xA;to modify this Agreement. IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may &#xA;assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable &#xA;separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a &#xA;distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may &#xA;always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which &#xA;it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is &#xA;published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its &#xA;Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in &#xA;Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to &#xA;the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether &#xA;expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program &#xA;not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the &#xA;intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this &#xA;Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year &#xA;after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury &#xA;trial in any resulting litigation. &#xA;&#xA;'/>

For purposes of this definition, control means (a)Ã¡the&#xA;power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management&#xA;of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or&#xA;(b)Ã¡ownership of more than fifty percent (50%) of the&#xA;outstanding shares or beneficial ownership of such entity.&#xA;&#xA;2. License Grants.&#xA;&#xA;2.1. The Initial Developer Grant.  Conditioned upon Your compliance&#xA;with Section 3.1 below and subject to third party intellectual&#xA;property claims, the Initial Developer hereby grants You a world-wide,&#xA;royalty-free, non-exclusive license: (a) under intellectual property&#xA;rights (other than patent or trademark) Licensable by Initial&#xA;Developer, to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and&#xA;distribute the Original Software (or portions thereof), with or&#xA;without Modifications, and/or as part of a Larger Work; and (b) under&#xA;Patent Claims infringed by the making, using or selling of Original&#xA;Software, to make, have made, use, practice, sell, and offer for sale,&#xA;and/or otherwise dispose of the Original Software (or portions&#xA;thereof).  (c) The licenses granted in SectionsÃ¡2.1(a) and (b) are&#xA;effective on the date Initial Developer first distributes or otherwise&#xA;makes the Original Software available to a third party under the terms&#xA;of this License.  (d) Notwithstanding SectionÃ¡2.1(b) above, no patent&#xA;license is granted: (1)Ã¡for code that You delete from the Original&#xA;Software, or (2)Ã¡for infringements caused by: (i)Ã¡the modification of&#xA;the Original Software, or (ii)Ã¡the combination of the Original&#xA;Software with other software or devices.&#xA;&#xA;2.2. Contributor Grant.  Conditioned upon Your compliance with Section&#xA;3.1 below and subject to third party intellectual property claims,&#xA;each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,&#xA;non-exclusive license: (a) under intellectual property rights (other&#xA;than patent or trademark) Licensable by Contributor to use, reproduce,&#xA;modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications&#xA;created by such Contributor (or portions thereof), either on an&#xA;unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Software and/or&#xA;as part of a Larger Work; and (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the&#xA;making, using, or selling of Modifications made by that Contributor&#xA;either alone and/or in combination with its Contributor Version (or&#xA;portions of such combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale,&#xA;have made, and/or otherwise dispose of: (1)Ã¡Modifications made by that&#xA;Contributor (or portions thereof); and (2)Ã¡the combination of&#xA;Modifications made by that Contributor with its Contributor Version&#xA;(or portions of such combination).  (c) The licenses granted in&#xA;SectionsÃ¡2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are effective on the date Contributor first&#xA;distributes or otherwise makes the Modifications available to a third&#xA;party.  (d) Notwithstanding SectionÃ¡2.2(b) above, no patent license is&#xA;granted: (1)Ã¡for any code that Contributor has deleted from the&#xA;Contributor Version; (2)Ã¡for infringements caused by: (i)Ã¡third party&#xA;modifications of Contributor Version, or (ii)Ã¡the combination of&#xA;Modifications made by that Contributor with other software (except as&#xA;part of the Contributor Version) or other devices; or (3)Ã¡under Patent&#xA;Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of Modifications&#xA;made by that Contributor.&#xA;&#xA;3. Distribution Obligations.&#xA;&#xA;3.1. Availability of Source Code.&#xA;&#xA;Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available&#xA;in Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form and&#xA;that Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms of this&#xA;License. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of&#xA;the Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or&#xA;otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any such&#xA;Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can obtain such&#xA;Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or&#xA;through a medium customarily used for software exchange.&#xA;&#xA;3.2. Modifications.&#xA;&#xA;The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are&#xA;governed by the terms of this License. You represent that You believe&#xA;Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You have&#xA;sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.&#xA;&#xA;3.3. Required Notices.  You must include a notice in each of Your&#xA;Modifications that identifies You as the Contributor of the&#xA;Modification. You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or&#xA;trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, or any&#xA;notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving attribution to any&#xA;Contributor or the Initial Developer.&#xA;&#xA;3.4. Application of Additional Terms.  You may not offer or impose any&#xA;terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form that alters or&#xA;restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients&#xA;rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,&#xA;warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more&#xA;recipients of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your&#xA;own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any&#xA;Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty,&#xA;support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone,&#xA;and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every&#xA;Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or&#xA;such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or&#xA;liability terms You offer.&#xA;&#xA;3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.  You may distribute the&#xA;Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms of this&#xA;License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may&#xA;contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in&#xA;compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the&#xA;Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients&#xA;rights in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this&#xA;License. If You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form&#xA;under a different license, You must make it absolutely clear that any&#xA;terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by&#xA;the Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify&#xA;the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred&#xA;by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such&#xA;terms You offer.&#xA;&#xA;3.6. Larger Works.  You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered&#xA;Software with other code not governed by the terms of this License and&#xA;distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You&#xA;must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the&#xA;Covered Software.&#xA;&#xA;4. Versions of the License.&#xA;&#xA;4.1. New Versions.  Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license&#xA;steward and may publish revised and/or new versions of this License&#xA;from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version&#xA;number. Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than the&#xA;license steward has the right to modify this License.&#xA;&#xA;4.2. Effect of New Versions.&#xA;&#xA;You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the&#xA;Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the&#xA;License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If&#xA;the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software&#xA;prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available&#xA;under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and&#xA;make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of&#xA;the License under which You originally received the Covered&#xA;Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or&#xA;otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any&#xA;subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.&#xA;4.3. Modified Versions.&#xA;&#xA;When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license&#xA;for Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version&#xA;of this License if You: (a)Ã¡rename the license and remove any&#xA;references to the name of the license steward (except to note that the&#xA;license differs from this License); and (b)Ã¡otherwise make it clear&#xA;that the license contains terms which differ from this License.&#xA;&#xA;5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.&#xA;&#xA;COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN AS IS BASIS,&#xA;WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,&#xA;WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF&#xA;DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR&#xA;NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF&#xA;THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE&#xA;DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER&#xA;CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR&#xA;CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART&#xA;OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED&#xA;HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.&#xA;&#xA;6. TERMINATION.&#xA;&#xA;6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate&#xA;automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to&#xA;cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the&#xA;breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect&#xA;beyond the termination of this License shall survive.&#xA;&#xA;6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory&#xA;judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the&#xA;Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such&#xA;claim is referred to as Participant) alleging that the&#xA;Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the&#xA;Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the&#xA;Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly&#xA;infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or&#xA;indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if&#xA;the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all&#xA;Contributors under SectionsÃ¡2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall,&#xA;upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and&#xA;automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice period,&#xA;unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with&#xA;respect to the Participant Software against such Participant&#xA;either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with&#xA;Participant.&#xA;&#xA;6.3. In the event of termination under SectionsÃ¡6.1 or 6.2 above, all&#xA;end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any&#xA;distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses&#xA;granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.&#xA;&#xA;7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.&#xA;&#xA;UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT&#xA;(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL&#xA;DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED&#xA;SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY&#xA;PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES&#xA;OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST&#xA;PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR&#xA;MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN&#xA;IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH&#xA;DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR&#xA;DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTYS NEGLIGENCE TO THE&#xA;EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO&#xA;NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL&#xA;DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.&#xA;&#xA;8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.&#xA;&#xA;The Covered Software is a commercial item, as that term is defined in&#xA;48Ã¡C.F.R.Ã¡2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of commercial computer&#xA;software (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. Ã¡252.227-7014(a)(1))&#xA;and commercial computer software documentation as such terms are used&#xA;in 48Ã¡C.F.R.Ã¡12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and&#xA;48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all&#xA;U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only those&#xA;rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu&#xA;of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision&#xA;that addresses Government rights in computer software under this&#xA;License.&#xA;&#xA;9. MISCELLANEOUS.&#xA;&#xA;This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject&#xA;matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be&#xA;unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent&#xA;necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by&#xA;the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within the&#xA;Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any,&#xA;provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdictions conflict-of-law&#xA;provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject&#xA;to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and&#xA;venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software,&#xA;with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without&#xA;limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and&#xA;expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on&#xA;Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly&#xA;excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a&#xA;contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to&#xA;this License. You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance&#xA;with the United States export administration regulations (and the&#xA;export control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You&#xA;use, distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.&#xA;&#xA;10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.&#xA;&#xA;As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is&#xA;responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,&#xA;out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to&#xA;work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such&#xA;responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or&#xA;shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.&#xA;&#xA;NOTICE PURSUANT TO SECTION 9 OF THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND&#xA;DISTRIBUTION LICENSE (CDDL) The GlassFish code released under the CDDL&#xA;shall be governed by the laws of the State of California (excluding&#xA;conflict-of-law provisions). Any litigation relating to this License&#xA;shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the&#xA;Northern District of California and the state courts of the State of&#xA;California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California.&#xA;&#xA;For plexus-archiver-1.0-alpha-7.jar:&#xA;&#xA;=========================================================================&#xA;==  Plexus License                                                     ==&#xA;=========================================================================&#xA;&#xA;Common Public License - v 1.0 &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON &#xA;PUBLIC LICENSE (&quot;AGREEMENT&quot;). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE &#xA;PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT&apos;S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;1. DEFINITIONS &#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contribution&quot; means: &#xA;&#xA;a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and &#xA;documentation distributed under this Agreement, and&#xA;&#xA;b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:&#xA;&#xA;i) changes to the Program, and&#xA;&#xA;ii) additions to the Program;&#xA;&#xA;where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are &#xA;distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution &apos;originates&apos; &#xA;from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor &#xA;itself or anyone acting on such Contributor&apos;s behalf. Contributions do not &#xA;include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of &#xA;software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own &#xA;license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program. &#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contributor&quot; means any person or entity that distributes the Program. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Licensed Patents &quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which &#xA;are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or &#xA;when combined with the Program. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Program&quot; means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this &#xA;Agreement. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, &#xA;including all Contributors. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;2. GRANT OF RIGHTS &#xA;&#xA;a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants &#xA;Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to &#xA;reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly &#xA;perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, &#xA;if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.&#xA;&#xA;b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants &#xA;Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under &#xA;Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise &#xA;transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and &#xA;object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the &#xA;Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by &#xA;the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination &#xA;to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply &#xA;to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se &#xA;is licensed hereunder. &#xA;&#xA;c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses &#xA;to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any &#xA;Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other &#xA;intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims &#xA;any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on &#xA;infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to &#xA;exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby &#xA;assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights &#xA;needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to &#xA;allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient&apos;s responsibility &#xA;to acquire that license before distributing the Program.&#xA;&#xA;d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient &#xA;copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license &#xA;set forth in this Agreement.&#xA;&#xA;3. REQUIREMENTS &#xA;&#xA;A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under &#xA;its own license agreement, provided that: &#xA;&#xA;a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and&#xA;&#xA;b) its license agreement:&#xA;&#xA;i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and &#xA;conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title &#xA;and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability &#xA;and fitness for a particular purpose; &#xA;&#xA;ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for &#xA;damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential &#xA;damages, such as lost profits; &#xA;&#xA;iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered &#xA;by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and&#xA;&#xA;iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such &#xA;Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on &#xA;or through a medium customarily used for software exchange. &#xA;&#xA;When the Program is made available in source code form: &#xA;&#xA;a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and &#xA;&#xA;b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program. &#xA;&#xA;Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within &#xA;the Program. &#xA;&#xA;Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its &#xA;Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent &#xA;Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution. &#xA;&#xA;4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION &#xA;&#xA;Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities &#xA;with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this &#xA;license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the &#xA;Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering &#xA;should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for &#xA;other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a &#xA;commercial product offering, such Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;) &#xA;hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (&quot;Indemnified &#xA;Contributor&quot;) against any losses, damages and costs (collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) &#xA;arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third &#xA;party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts &#xA;or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its &#xA;distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The &#xA;obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating &#xA;to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to &#xA;qualify, &#xA;an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial &#xA;Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial &#xA;Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, &#xA;the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified &#xA;Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial &#xA;product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial &#xA;Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, &#xA;or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and &#xA;warranties are such Commercial Contributor&apos;s responsibility alone. Under &#xA;this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims &#xA;against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and &#xA;warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any &#xA;damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;5. NO WARRANTY &#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED &#xA;ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER &#xA;EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR &#xA;CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A &#xA;PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining &#xA;the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all &#xA;risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, &#xA;including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, &#xA;compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or &#xA;equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY &#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY &#xA;CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, &#xA;SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION &#xA;LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN &#xA;CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) &#xA;ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE &#xA;EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE &#xA;POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;7. GENERAL &#xA;&#xA;If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under &#xA;applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of &#xA;the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action &#xA;by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum &#xA;extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with &#xA;respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or &#xA;counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that &#xA;Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as &#xA;of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient &#xA;institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim &#xA;or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding &#xA;combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes &#xA;such Recipient&apos;s patent(s), then such Recipient&apos;s rights granted under &#xA;Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;All Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails &#xA;to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement &#xA;and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after &#xA;becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient&apos;s rights under this &#xA;Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the &#xA;Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient&apos;s obligations &#xA;under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the &#xA;Program shall continue and survive. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, &#xA;but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may &#xA;only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves &#xA;the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement &#xA;from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right &#xA;to modify this Agreement. IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may &#xA;assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable &#xA;separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a &#xA;distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may &#xA;always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which &#xA;it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is &#xA;published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its &#xA;Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in &#xA;Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to &#xA;the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether &#xA;expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program &#xA;not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the &#xA;intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this &#xA;Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year &#xA;after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury &#xA;trial in any resulting litigation. &#xA;&#xA;'/>

Distribution Obligations.&#xA;&#xA;3.1. Availability of Source Code.&#xA;&#xA;Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available&#xA;in Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form and&#xA;that Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms of this&#xA;License. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of&#xA;the Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or&#xA;otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any such&#xA;Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can obtain such&#xA;Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or&#xA;through a medium customarily used for software exchange.&#xA;&#xA;3.2. Modifications.&#xA;&#xA;The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are&#xA;governed by the terms of this License. You represent that You believe&#xA;Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You have&#xA;sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.&#xA;&#xA;3.3. Required Notices.  You must include a notice in each of Your&#xA;Modifications that identifies You as the Contributor of the&#xA;Modification. You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or&#xA;trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, or any&#xA;notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving attribution to any&#xA;Contributor or the Initial Developer.&#xA;&#xA;3.4. Application of Additional Terms.  You may not offer or impose any&#xA;terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form that alters or&#xA;restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients&#xA;rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,&#xA;warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more&#xA;recipients of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your&#xA;own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any&#xA;Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty,&#xA;support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone,&#xA;and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every&#xA;Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or&#xA;such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or&#xA;liability terms You offer.&#xA;&#xA;3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.  You may distribute the&#xA;Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms of this&#xA;License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may&#xA;contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in&#xA;compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the&#xA;Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients&#xA;rights in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this&#xA;License. If You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form&#xA;under a different license, You must make it absolutely clear that any&#xA;terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by&#xA;the Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify&#xA;the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred&#xA;by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such&#xA;terms You offer.&#xA;&#xA;3.6. Larger Works.  You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered&#xA;Software with other code not governed by the terms of this License and&#xA;distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You&#xA;must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the&#xA;Covered Software.&#xA;&#xA;4. Versions of the License.&#xA;&#xA;4.1. New Versions.  Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license&#xA;steward and may publish revised and/or new versions of this License&#xA;from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version&#xA;number. Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than the&#xA;license steward has the right to modify this License.&#xA;&#xA;4.2. Effect of New Versions.&#xA;&#xA;You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the&#xA;Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the&#xA;License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If&#xA;the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software&#xA;prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available&#xA;under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and&#xA;make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of&#xA;the License under which You originally received the Covered&#xA;Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or&#xA;otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any&#xA;subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.&#xA;4.3. Modified Versions.&#xA;&#xA;When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license&#xA;for Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version&#xA;of this License if You: (a)Ã¡rename the license and remove any&#xA;references to the name of the license steward (except to note that the&#xA;license differs from this License); and (b)Ã¡otherwise make it clear&#xA;that the license contains terms which differ from this License.&#xA;&#xA;5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.&#xA;&#xA;COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN AS IS BASIS,&#xA;WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,&#xA;WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF&#xA;DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR&#xA;NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF&#xA;THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU.

THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART&#xA;OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED&#xA;HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.&#xA;&#xA;6. TERMINATION.&#xA;&#xA;6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate&#xA;automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to&#xA;cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the&#xA;breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect&#xA;beyond the termination of this License shall survive.&#xA;&#xA;6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory&#xA;judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the&#xA;Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such&#xA;claim is referred to as Participant) alleging that the&#xA;Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the&#xA;Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the&#xA;Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly&#xA;infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or&#xA;indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if&#xA;the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all&#xA;Contributors under SectionsÃ¡2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall,&#xA;upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and&#xA;automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice period,&#xA;unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with&#xA;respect to the Participant Software against such Participant&#xA;either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with&#xA;Participant.&#xA;&#xA;6.3. In the event of termination under SectionsÃ¡6.1 or 6.2 above, all&#xA;end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any&#xA;distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses&#xA;granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.&#xA;&#xA;7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.&#xA;&#xA;UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT&#xA;(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL&#xA;DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED&#xA;SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY&#xA;PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES&#xA;OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST&#xA;PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR&#xA;MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN&#xA;IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH&#xA;DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR&#xA;DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTYS NEGLIGENCE TO THE&#xA;EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO&#xA;NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL&#xA;DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.&#xA;&#xA;8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.&#xA;&#xA;The Covered Software is a commercial item, as that term is defined in&#xA;48Ã¡C.F.R.Ã¡2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of commercial computer&#xA;software (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. Ã¡252.227-7014(a)(1))&#xA;and commercial computer software documentation as such terms are used&#xA;in 48Ã¡C.F.R.Ã¡12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and&#xA;48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all&#xA;U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only those&#xA;rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu&#xA;of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision&#xA;that addresses Government rights in computer software under this&#xA;License.&#xA;&#xA;9. MISCELLANEOUS.&#xA;&#xA;This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject&#xA;matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be&#xA;unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent&#xA;necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by&#xA;the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within the&#xA;Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any,&#xA;provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdictions conflict-of-law&#xA;provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject&#xA;to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and&#xA;venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software,&#xA;with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without&#xA;limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and&#xA;expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on&#xA;Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly&#xA;excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a&#xA;contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to&#xA;this License. You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance&#xA;with the United States export administration regulations (and the&#xA;export control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You&#xA;use, distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.&#xA;&#xA;10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.&#xA;&#xA;As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is&#xA;responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,&#xA;out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to&#xA;work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such&#xA;responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or&#xA;shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.&#xA;&#xA;NOTICE PURSUANT TO SECTION 9 OF THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND&#xA;DISTRIBUTION LICENSE (CDDL) The GlassFish code released under the CDDL&#xA;shall be governed by the laws of the State of California (excluding&#xA;conflict-of-law provisions). Any litigation relating to this License&#xA;shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the&#xA;Northern District of California and the state courts of the State of&#xA;California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California.&#xA;&#xA;For plexus-archiver-1.0-alpha-7.jar:&#xA;&#xA;=========================================================================&#xA;==  Plexus License                                                     ==&#xA;=========================================================================&#xA;&#xA;Common Public License - v 1.0 &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON &#xA;PUBLIC LICENSE (&quot;AGREEMENT&quot;). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE &#xA;PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT&apos;S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;1. DEFINITIONS &#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contribution&quot; means: &#xA;&#xA;a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and &#xA;documentation distributed under this Agreement, and&#xA;&#xA;b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:&#xA;&#xA;i) changes to the Program, and&#xA;&#xA;ii) additions to the Program;&#xA;&#xA;where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are &#xA;distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution &apos;originates&apos; &#xA;from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor &#xA;itself or anyone acting on such Contributor&apos;s behalf. Contributions do not &#xA;include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of &#xA;software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own &#xA;license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program. &#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contributor&quot; means any person or entity that distributes the Program. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Licensed Patents &quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which &#xA;are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or &#xA;when combined with the Program. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Program&quot; means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this &#xA;Agreement. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, &#xA;including all Contributors. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;2. GRANT OF RIGHTS &#xA;&#xA;a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants &#xA;Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to &#xA;reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly &#xA;perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, &#xA;if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.&#xA;&#xA;b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants &#xA;Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under &#xA;Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise &#xA;transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and &#xA;object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the &#xA;Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by &#xA;the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination &#xA;to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply &#xA;to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se &#xA;is licensed hereunder. &#xA;&#xA;c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses &#xA;to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any &#xA;Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other &#xA;intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims &#xA;any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on &#xA;infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to &#xA;exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby &#xA;assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights &#xA;needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to &#xA;allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient&apos;s responsibility &#xA;to acquire that license before distributing the Program.&#xA;&#xA;d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient &#xA;copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license &#xA;set forth in this Agreement.&#xA;&#xA;3. REQUIREMENTS &#xA;&#xA;A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under &#xA;its own license agreement, provided that: &#xA;&#xA;a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and&#xA;&#xA;b) its license agreement:&#xA;&#xA;i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and &#xA;conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title &#xA;and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability &#xA;and fitness for a particular purpose; &#xA;&#xA;ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for &#xA;damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential &#xA;damages, such as lost profits; &#xA;&#xA;iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered &#xA;by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and&#xA;&#xA;iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such &#xA;Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on &#xA;or through a medium customarily used for software exchange. &#xA;&#xA;When the Program is made available in source code form: &#xA;&#xA;a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and &#xA;&#xA;b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program. &#xA;&#xA;Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within &#xA;the Program. &#xA;&#xA;Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its &#xA;Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent &#xA;Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution. &#xA;&#xA;4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION &#xA;&#xA;Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities &#xA;with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this &#xA;license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the &#xA;Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering &#xA;should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for &#xA;other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a &#xA;commercial product offering, such Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;) &#xA;hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (&quot;Indemnified &#xA;Contributor&quot;) against any losses, damages and costs (collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) &#xA;arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third &#xA;party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts &#xA;or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its &#xA;distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The &#xA;obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating &#xA;to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to &#xA;qualify, &#xA;an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial &#xA;Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial &#xA;Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, &#xA;the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified &#xA;Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial &#xA;product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial &#xA;Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, &#xA;or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and &#xA;warranties are such Commercial Contributor&apos;s responsibility alone. Under &#xA;this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims &#xA;against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and &#xA;warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any &#xA;damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;5. NO WARRANTY &#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED &#xA;ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER &#xA;EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR &#xA;CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A &#xA;PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining &#xA;the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all &#xA;risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, &#xA;including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, &#xA;compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or &#xA;equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY &#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY &#xA;CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, &#xA;SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION &#xA;LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN &#xA;CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) &#xA;ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE &#xA;EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE &#xA;POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;7. GENERAL &#xA;&#xA;If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under &#xA;applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of &#xA;the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action &#xA;by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum &#xA;extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with &#xA;respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or &#xA;counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that &#xA;Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as &#xA;of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient &#xA;institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim &#xA;or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding &#xA;combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes &#xA;such Recipient&apos;s patent(s), then such Recipient&apos;s rights granted under &#xA;Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;All Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails &#xA;to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement &#xA;and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after &#xA;becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient&apos;s rights under this &#xA;Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the &#xA;Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient&apos;s obligations &#xA;under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the &#xA;Program shall continue and survive. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, &#xA;but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may &#xA;only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves &#xA;the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement &#xA;from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right &#xA;to modify this Agreement. IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may &#xA;assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable &#xA;separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a &#xA;distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may &#xA;always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which &#xA;it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is &#xA;published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its &#xA;Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in &#xA;Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to &#xA;the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether &#xA;expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program &#xA;not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the &#xA;intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this &#xA;Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year &#xA;after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury &#xA;trial in any resulting litigation. &#xA;&#xA;'/>

ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE &#xA;PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT&apos;S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;1. DEFINITIONS &#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contribution&quot; means: &#xA;&#xA;a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and &#xA;documentation distributed under this Agreement, and&#xA;&#xA;b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:&#xA;&#xA;i) changes to the Program, and&#xA;&#xA;ii) additions to the Program;&#xA;&#xA;where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are &#xA;distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution &apos;originates&apos; &#xA;from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor &#xA;itself or anyone acting on such Contributor&apos;s behalf. Contributions do not &#xA;include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of &#xA;software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own &#xA;license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program. &#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contributor&quot; means any person or entity that distributes the Program. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Licensed Patents &quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which &#xA;are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or &#xA;when combined with the Program. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Program&quot; means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this &#xA;Agreement. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, &#xA;including all Contributors. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;2. GRANT OF RIGHTS &#xA;&#xA;a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants &#xA;Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to &#xA;reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly &#xA;perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, &#xA;if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.&#xA;&#xA;b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants &#xA;Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under &#xA;Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise &#xA;transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and &#xA;object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the &#xA;Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by &#xA;the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination &#xA;to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply &#xA;to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se &#xA;is licensed hereunder. &#xA;&#xA;c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses &#xA;to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any &#xA;Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other &#xA;intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims &#xA;any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on &#xA;infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to &#xA;exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby &#xA;assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights &#xA;needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to &#xA;allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient&apos;s responsibility &#xA;to acquire that license before distributing the Program.&#xA;&#xA;d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient &#xA;copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license &#xA;set forth in this Agreement.&#xA;&#xA;3. REQUIREMENTS &#xA;&#xA;A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under &#xA;its own license agreement, provided that: &#xA;&#xA;a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and&#xA;&#xA;b) its license agreement:&#xA;&#xA;i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and &#xA;conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title &#xA;and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability &#xA;and fitness for a particular purpose; &#xA;&#xA;ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for &#xA;damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential &#xA;damages, such as lost profits; &#xA;&#xA;iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered &#xA;by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and&#xA;&#xA;iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such &#xA;Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on &#xA;or through a medium customarily used for software exchange. &#xA;&#xA;When the Program is made available in source code form: &#xA;&#xA;a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and &#xA;&#xA;b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program. &#xA;&#xA;Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within &#xA;the Program. &#xA;&#xA;Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its &#xA;Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent &#xA;Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution. &#xA;&#xA;4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION &#xA;&#xA;Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities &#xA;with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this &#xA;license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the &#xA;Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering &#xA;should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for &#xA;other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a &#xA;commercial product offering, such Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;) &#xA;hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (&quot;Indemnified &#xA;Contributor&quot;) against any losses, damages and costs (collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) &#xA;arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third &#xA;party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts &#xA;or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its &#xA;distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The &#xA;obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating &#xA;to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to &#xA;qualify, &#xA;an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial &#xA;Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial &#xA;Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, &#xA;the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified &#xA;Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial &#xA;product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial &#xA;Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, &#xA;or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and &#xA;warranties are such Commercial Contributor&apos;s responsibility alone. Under &#xA;this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims &#xA;against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and &#xA;warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any &#xA;damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;5. NO WARRANTY &#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED &#xA;ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER &#xA;EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR &#xA;CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A &#xA;PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining &#xA;the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all &#xA;risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, &#xA;including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, &#xA;compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or &#xA;equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY &#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY &#xA;CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, &#xA;SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION &#xA;LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN &#xA;CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) &#xA;ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE &#xA;EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE &#xA;POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;7. GENERAL &#xA;&#xA;If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under &#xA;applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of &#xA;the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action &#xA;by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum &#xA;extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with &#xA;respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or &#xA;counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that &#xA;Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as &#xA;of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient &#xA;institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim &#xA;or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding &#xA;combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes &#xA;such Recipient&apos;s patent(s), then such Recipient&apos;s rights granted under &#xA;Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;All Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails &#xA;to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement &#xA;and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after &#xA;becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient&apos;s rights under this &#xA;Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the &#xA;Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient&apos;s obligations &#xA;under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the &#xA;Program shall continue and survive. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, &#xA;but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may &#xA;only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves &#xA;the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement &#xA;from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right &#xA;to modify this Agreement. IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may &#xA;assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable &#xA;separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a &#xA;distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may &#xA;always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which &#xA;it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is &#xA;published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its &#xA;Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in &#xA;Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to &#xA;the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether &#xA;expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program &#xA;not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the &#xA;intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this &#xA;Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year &#xA;after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury &#xA;trial in any resulting litigation. &#xA;'/>

Distribution Obligations.&#xA;&#xA;3.1. Availability of Source Code.&#xA;&#xA;Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available&#xA;in Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form and&#xA;that Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms of this&#xA;License. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of&#xA;the Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or&#xA;otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any such&#xA;Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can obtain such&#xA;Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or&#xA;through a medium customarily used for software exchange.&#xA;&#xA;3.2. Modifications.&#xA;&#xA;The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are&#xA;governed by the terms of this License. You represent that You believe&#xA;Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You have&#xA;sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.&#xA;&#xA;3.3. Required Notices.  You must include a notice in each of Your&#xA;Modifications that identifies You as the Contributor of the&#xA;Modification. You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or&#xA;trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, or any&#xA;notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving attribution to any&#xA;Contributor or the Initial Developer.&#xA;&#xA;3.4. Application of Additional Terms.  You may not offer or impose any&#xA;terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form that alters or&#xA;restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients&#xA;rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,&#xA;warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more&#xA;recipients of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your&#xA;own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any&#xA;Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty,&#xA;support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone,&#xA;and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every&#xA;Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or&#xA;such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or&#xA;liability terms You offer.&#xA;&#xA;3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.  You may distribute the&#xA;Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms of this&#xA;License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may&#xA;contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in&#xA;compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the&#xA;Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients&#xA;rights in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this&#xA;License. If You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form&#xA;under a different license, You must make it absolutely clear that any&#xA;terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by&#xA;the Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify&#xA;the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred&#xA;by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such&#xA;terms You offer.&#xA;&#xA;3.6. Larger Works.  You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered&#xA;Software with other code not governed by the terms of this License and&#xA;distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You&#xA;must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the&#xA;Covered Software.&#xA;&#xA;4. Versions of the License.&#xA;&#xA;4.1. New Versions.  Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license&#xA;steward and may publish revised and/or new versions of this License&#xA;from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version&#xA;number. Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than the&#xA;license steward has the right to modify this License.&#xA;&#xA;4.2. Effect of New Versions.&#xA;&#xA;You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the&#xA;Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the&#xA;License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If&#xA;the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software&#xA;prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available&#xA;under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and&#xA;make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of&#xA;the License under which You originally received the Covered&#xA;Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or&#xA;otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any&#xA;subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.&#xA;4.3. Modified Versions.&#xA;&#xA;When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license&#xA;for Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version&#xA;of this License if You: (a)Ã¡rename the license and remove any&#xA;references to the name of the license steward (except to note that the&#xA;license differs from this License); and (b)Ã¡otherwise make it clear&#xA;that the license contains terms which differ from this License.&#xA;&#xA;5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.&#xA;&#xA;COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN AS IS BASIS,&#xA;WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,&#xA;WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF&#xA;DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR&#xA;NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF&#xA;THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU.

THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART&#xA;OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED&#xA;HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.&#xA;&#xA;6. TERMINATION.&#xA;&#xA;6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate&#xA;automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to&#xA;cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the&#xA;breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect&#xA;beyond the termination of this License shall survive.&#xA;&#xA;6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory&#xA;judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the&#xA;Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such&#xA;claim is referred to as Participant) alleging that the&#xA;Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the&#xA;Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the&#xA;Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly&#xA;infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or&#xA;indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if&#xA;the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all&#xA;Contributors under SectionsÃ¡2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall,&#xA;upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and&#xA;automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice period,&#xA;unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with&#xA;respect to the Participant Software against such Participant&#xA;either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with&#xA;Participant.&#xA;&#xA;6.3. In the event of termination under SectionsÃ¡6.1 or 6.2 above, all&#xA;end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any&#xA;distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses&#xA;granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.&#xA;&#xA;7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.&#xA;&#xA;UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT&#xA;(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL&#xA;DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED&#xA;SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY&#xA;PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES&#xA;OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST&#xA;PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR&#xA;MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN&#xA;IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH&#xA;DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR&#xA;DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTYS NEGLIGENCE TO THE&#xA;EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO&#xA;NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL&#xA;DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.&#xA;&#xA;8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.&#xA;&#xA;The Covered Software is a commercial item, as that term is defined in&#xA;48Ã¡C.F.R.Ã¡2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of commercial computer&#xA;software (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. Ã¡252.227-7014(a)(1))&#xA;and commercial computer software documentation as such terms are used&#xA;in 48Ã¡C.F.R.Ã¡12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and&#xA;48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all&#xA;U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only those&#xA;rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu&#xA;of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision&#xA;that addresses Government rights in computer software under this&#xA;License.&#xA;&#xA;9. MISCELLANEOUS.&#xA;&#xA;This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject&#xA;matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be&#xA;unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent&#xA;necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by&#xA;the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within the&#xA;Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any,&#xA;provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdictions conflict-of-law&#xA;provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject&#xA;to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and&#xA;venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software,&#xA;with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without&#xA;limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and&#xA;expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on&#xA;Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly&#xA;excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a&#xA;contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to&#xA;this License.

Any litigation relating to this License&#xA;shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the&#xA;Northern District of California and the state courts of the State of&#xA;California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California.&#xA;&#xA;For plexus-archiver-1.0-alpha-7.jar:&#xA;&#xA;=========================================================================&#xA;==  Plexus License                                                     ==&#xA;=========================================================================&#xA;&#xA;Common Public License - v 1.0 &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON &#xA;PUBLIC LICENSE (&quot;AGREEMENT&quot;). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE &#xA;PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT&apos;S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;1. DEFINITIONS &#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contribution&quot; means: &#xA;&#xA;a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and &#xA;documentation distributed under this Agreement, and&#xA;&#xA;b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:&#xA;&#xA;i) changes to the Program, and&#xA;&#xA;ii) additions to the Program;&#xA;&#xA;where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are &#xA;distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution &apos;originates&apos; &#xA;from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor &#xA;itself or anyone acting on such Contributor&apos;s behalf. Contributions do not &#xA;include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of &#xA;software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own &#xA;license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program. &#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contributor&quot; means any person or entity that distributes the Program. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Licensed Patents &quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which &#xA;are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or &#xA;when combined with the Program. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Program&quot; means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this &#xA;Agreement. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, &#xA;including all Contributors. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;2. GRANT OF RIGHTS &#xA;&#xA;a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants &#xA;Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to &#xA;reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly &#xA;perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, &#xA;if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.&#xA;&#xA;b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants &#xA;Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under &#xA;Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise &#xA;transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and &#xA;object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the &#xA;Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by &#xA;the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination &#xA;to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply &#xA;to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se &#xA;is licensed hereunder. &#xA;&#xA;c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses &#xA;to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any &#xA;Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other &#xA;intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims &#xA;any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on &#xA;infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to &#xA;exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby &#xA;assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights &#xA;needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to &#xA;allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient&apos;s responsibility &#xA;to acquire that license before distributing the Program.&#xA;&#xA;d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient &#xA;copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license &#xA;set forth in this Agreement.&#xA;&#xA;3. REQUIREMENTS &#xA;&#xA;A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under &#xA;its own license agreement, provided that: &#xA;&#xA;a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and&#xA;&#xA;b) its license agreement:&#xA;&#xA;i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and &#xA;conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title &#xA;and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability &#xA;and fitness for a particular purpose; &#xA;&#xA;ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for &#xA;damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential &#xA;damages, such as lost profits; &#xA;&#xA;iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered &#xA;by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and&#xA;&#xA;iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such &#xA;Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on &#xA;or through a medium customarily used for software exchange. &#xA;&#xA;When the Program is made available in source code form: &#xA;&#xA;a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and &#xA;&#xA;b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program. &#xA;&#xA;Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within &#xA;the Program. &#xA;&#xA;Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its &#xA;Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent &#xA;Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution. &#xA;&#xA;4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION &#xA;&#xA;Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities &#xA;with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this &#xA;license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the &#xA;Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering &#xA;should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for &#xA;other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a &#xA;commercial product offering, such Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;) &#xA;hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (&quot;Indemnified &#xA;Contributor&quot;) against any losses, damages and costs (collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) &#xA;arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third &#xA;party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts &#xA;or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its &#xA;distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The &#xA;obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating &#xA;to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to &#xA;qualify, &#xA;an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial &#xA;Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial &#xA;Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, &#xA;the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified &#xA;Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial &#xA;product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial &#xA;Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, &#xA;or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and &#xA;warranties are such Commercial Contributor&apos;s responsibility alone. Under &#xA;this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims &#xA;against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and &#xA;warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any &#xA;damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;5. NO WARRANTY &#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED &#xA;ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER &#xA;EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR &#xA;CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A &#xA;PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining &#xA;the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all &#xA;risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, &#xA;including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, &#xA;compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or &#xA;equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY &#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY &#xA;CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, &#xA;SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION &#xA;LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN &#xA;CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) &#xA;ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE &#xA;EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE &#xA;POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;7. GENERAL &#xA;&#xA;If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under &#xA;applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of &#xA;the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action &#xA;by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum &#xA;extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with &#xA;respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or &#xA;counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that &#xA;Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as &#xA;of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient &#xA;institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim &#xA;or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding &#xA;combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes &#xA;such Recipient&apos;s patent(s), then such Recipient&apos;s rights granted under &#xA;Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;All Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails &#xA;to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement &#xA;and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after &#xA;becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient&apos;s rights under this &#xA;Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the &#xA;Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient&apos;s obligations &#xA;under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the &#xA;Program shall continue and survive. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, &#xA;but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may &#xA;only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves &#xA;the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement &#xA;from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right &#xA;to modify this Agreement. IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may &#xA;assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable &#xA;separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a &#xA;distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may &#xA;always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which &#xA;it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is &#xA;published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its &#xA;Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in &#xA;Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to &#xA;the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether &#xA;expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program &#xA;not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the &#xA;intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this &#xA;Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year &#xA;after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury &#xA;trial in any resulting litigation. &#xA;&#xA;'/>

Distribution Obligations.&#xA;&#xA;3.1. Availability of Source Code.&#xA;&#xA;Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available&#xA;in Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form and&#xA;that Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms of this&#xA;License. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of&#xA;the Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or&#xA;otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any such&#xA;Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can obtain such&#xA;Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or&#xA;through a medium customarily used for software exchange.&#xA;&#xA;3.2. Modifications.&#xA;&#xA;The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are&#xA;governed by the terms of this License. You represent that You believe&#xA;Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You have&#xA;sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.&#xA;&#xA;3.3. Required Notices.  You must include a notice in each of Your&#xA;Modifications that identifies You as the Contributor of the&#xA;Modification. You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or&#xA;trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, or any&#xA;notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving attribution to any&#xA;Contributor or the Initial Developer.&#xA;&#xA;3.4. Application of Additional Terms.  You may not offer or impose any&#xA;terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form that alters or&#xA;restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients&#xA;rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,&#xA;warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more&#xA;recipients of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your&#xA;own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any&#xA;Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty,&#xA;support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone,&#xA;and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every&#xA;Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or&#xA;such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or&#xA;liability terms You offer.&#xA;&#xA;3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.  You may distribute the&#xA;Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms of this&#xA;License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may&#xA;contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in&#xA;compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the&#xA;Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients&#xA;rights in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this&#xA;License. If You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form&#xA;under a different license, You must make it absolutely clear that any&#xA;terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by&#xA;the Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify&#xA;the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred&#xA;by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such&#xA;terms You offer.&#xA;&#xA;3.6. Larger Works.  You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered&#xA;Software with other code not governed by the terms of this License and&#xA;distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You&#xA;must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the&#xA;Covered Software.&#xA;&#xA;4. Versions of the License.&#xA;&#xA;4.1. New Versions.  Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license&#xA;steward and may publish revised and/or new versions of this License&#xA;from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version&#xA;number. Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than the&#xA;license steward has the right to modify this License.&#xA;&#xA;4.2. Effect of New Versions.&#xA;&#xA;You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the&#xA;Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the&#xA;License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If&#xA;the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software&#xA;prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available&#xA;under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and&#xA;make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of&#xA;the License under which You originally received the Covered&#xA;Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or&#xA;otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any&#xA;subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.&#xA;4.3. Modified Versions.&#xA;&#xA;When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license&#xA;for Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version&#xA;of this License if You: (a)Ã¡rename the license and remove any&#xA;references to the name of the license steward (except to note that the&#xA;license differs from this License); and (b)Ã¡otherwise make it clear&#xA;that the license contains terms which differ from this License.&#xA;&#xA;5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.&#xA;&#xA;COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN AS IS BASIS,&#xA;WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,&#xA;WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF&#xA;DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR&#xA;NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF&#xA;THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE&#xA;DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER&#xA;CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR&#xA;CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART&#xA;OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED&#xA;HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.&#xA;&#xA;6. TERMINATION.&#xA;&#xA;6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate&#xA;automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to&#xA;cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the&#xA;breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect&#xA;beyond the termination of this License shall survive.&#xA;&#xA;6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory&#xA;judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the&#xA;Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such&#xA;claim is referred to as Participant) alleging that the&#xA;Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the&#xA;Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the&#xA;Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly&#xA;infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or&#xA;indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if&#xA;the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all&#xA;Contributors under SectionsÃ¡2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall,&#xA;upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and&#xA;automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice period,&#xA;unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with&#xA;respect to the Participant Software against such Participant&#xA;either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with&#xA;Participant.&#xA;&#xA;6.3. In the event of termination under SectionsÃ¡6.1 or 6.2 above, all&#xA;end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any&#xA;distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses&#xA;granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.&#xA;&#xA;7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.&#xA;&#xA;UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT&#xA;(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL&#xA;DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED&#xA;SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY&#xA;PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES&#xA;OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST&#xA;PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR&#xA;MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN&#xA;IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH&#xA;DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR&#xA;DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTYS NEGLIGENCE TO THE&#xA;EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO&#xA;NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL&#xA;DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.&#xA;&#xA;8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.&#xA;&#xA;The Covered Software is a commercial item, as that term is defined in&#xA;48Ã¡C.F.R.Ã¡2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of commercial computer&#xA;software (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. Ã¡252.227-7014(a)(1))&#xA;and commercial computer software documentation as such terms are used&#xA;in 48Ã¡C.F.R.Ã¡12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and&#xA;48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all&#xA;U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only those&#xA;rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu&#xA;of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision&#xA;that addresses Government rights in computer software under this&#xA;License.&#xA;&#xA;9. MISCELLANEOUS.&#xA;&#xA;This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject&#xA;matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be&#xA;unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent&#xA;necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by&#xA;the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within the&#xA;Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any,&#xA;provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdictions conflict-of-law&#xA;provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject&#xA;to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and&#xA;venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software,&#xA;with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without&#xA;limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and&#xA;expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on&#xA;Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly&#xA;excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a&#xA;contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to&#xA;this License. You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance&#xA;with the United States export administration regulations (and the&#xA;export control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You&#xA;use, distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.&#xA;&#xA;10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.&#xA;&#xA;As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is&#xA;responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,&#xA;out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to&#xA;work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such&#xA;responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or&#xA;shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.&#xA;&#xA;NOTICE PURSUANT TO SECTION 9 OF THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND&#xA;DISTRIBUTION LICENSE (CDDL) The GlassFish code released under the CDDL&#xA;shall be governed by the laws of the State of California (excluding&#xA;conflict-of-law provisions). Any litigation relating to this License&#xA;shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the&#xA;Northern District of California and the state courts of the State of&#xA;California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California.&#xA;&#xA;For plexus-archiver-1.0-alpha-7.jar:&#xA;&#xA;=========================================================================&#xA;==  Plexus License                                                     ==&#xA;=========================================================================&#xA;&#xA;Common Public License - v 1.0 &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON &#xA;PUBLIC LICENSE (&quot;AGREEMENT&quot;). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE &#xA;PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT&apos;S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;1. DEFINITIONS &#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contribution&quot; means: &#xA;&#xA;a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and &#xA;documentation distributed under this Agreement, and&#xA;&#xA;b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:&#xA;&#xA;i) changes to the Program, and&#xA;&#xA;ii) additions to the Program;&#xA;&#xA;where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are &#xA;distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution &apos;originates&apos; &#xA;from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor &#xA;itself or anyone acting on such Contributor&apos;s behalf. Contributions do not &#xA;include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of &#xA;software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own &#xA;license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program. &#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contributor&quot; means any person or entity that distributes the Program. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Licensed Patents &quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which &#xA;are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or &#xA;when combined with the Program. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Program&quot; means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this &#xA;Agreement. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, &#xA;including all Contributors. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;2. GRANT OF RIGHTS &#xA;&#xA;a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants &#xA;Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to &#xA;reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly &#xA;perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, &#xA;if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.&#xA;&#xA;b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants &#xA;Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under &#xA;Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise &#xA;transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and &#xA;object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the &#xA;Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by &#xA;the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination &#xA;to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply &#xA;to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se &#xA;is licensed hereunder. &#xA;&#xA;c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses &#xA;to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any &#xA;Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other &#xA;intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims &#xA;any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on &#xA;infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to &#xA;exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby &#xA;assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights &#xA;needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to &#xA;allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient&apos;s responsibility &#xA;to acquire that license before distributing the Program.&#xA;&#xA;d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient &#xA;copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license &#xA;set forth in this Agreement.&#xA;&#xA;3. REQUIREMENTS &#xA;&#xA;A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under &#xA;its own license agreement, provided that: &#xA;&#xA;a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and&#xA;&#xA;b) its license agreement:&#xA;&#xA;i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and &#xA;conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title &#xA;and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability &#xA;and fitness for a particular purpose; &#xA;&#xA;ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for &#xA;damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential &#xA;damages, such as lost profits; &#xA;&#xA;iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered &#xA;by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and&#xA;&#xA;iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such &#xA;Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on &#xA;or through a medium customarily used for software exchange. &#xA;&#xA;When the Program is made available in source code form: &#xA;&#xA;a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and &#xA;&#xA;b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program. &#xA;&#xA;Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within &#xA;the Program. &#xA;&#xA;Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its &#xA;Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent &#xA;Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution. &#xA;&#xA;4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION &#xA;&#xA;Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities &#xA;with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this &#xA;license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the &#xA;Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering &#xA;should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for &#xA;other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a &#xA;commercial product offering, such Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;) &#xA;hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (&quot;Indemnified &#xA;Contributor&quot;) against any losses, damages and costs (collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) &#xA;arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third &#xA;party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts &#xA;or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its &#xA;distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The &#xA;obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating &#xA;to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to &#xA;qualify, &#xA;an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial &#xA;Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial &#xA;Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, &#xA;the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified &#xA;Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial &#xA;product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial &#xA;Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, &#xA;or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and &#xA;warranties are such Commercial Contributor&apos;s responsibility alone. Under &#xA;this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims &#xA;against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and &#xA;warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any &#xA;damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;5. NO WARRANTY &#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED &#xA;ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER &#xA;EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR &#xA;CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A &#xA;PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining &#xA;the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all &#xA;risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, &#xA;including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, &#xA;compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or &#xA;equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY &#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY &#xA;CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, &#xA;SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION &#xA;LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN &#xA;CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) &#xA;ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE &#xA;EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE &#xA;POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;7. GENERAL &#xA;&#xA;If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under &#xA;applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of &#xA;the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action &#xA;by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum &#xA;extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with &#xA;respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or &#xA;counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that &#xA;Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as &#xA;of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient &#xA;institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim &#xA;or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding &#xA;combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes &#xA;such Recipient&apos;s patent(s), then such Recipient&apos;s rights granted under &#xA;Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;All Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails &#xA;to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement &#xA;and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after &#xA;becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient&apos;s rights under this &#xA;Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the &#xA;Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient&apos;s obligations &#xA;under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the &#xA;Program shall continue and survive. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, &#xA;but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may &#xA;only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves &#xA;the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement &#xA;from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right &#xA;to modify this Agreement. IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may &#xA;assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable &#xA;separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a &#xA;distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may &#xA;always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which &#xA;it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is &#xA;published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its &#xA;Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in &#xA;Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to &#xA;the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether &#xA;expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program &#xA;not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the &#xA;intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this &#xA;Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year &#xA;after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury &#xA;trial in any resulting litigation. &#xA;&#xA;'/>

Distribution Obligations.&#xA;&#xA;3.1. Availability of Source Code.&#xA;&#xA;Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available&#xA;in Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form and&#xA;that Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms of this&#xA;License. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of&#xA;the Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or&#xA;otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any such&#xA;Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can obtain such&#xA;Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or&#xA;through a medium customarily used for software exchange.&#xA;&#xA;3.2. Modifications.&#xA;&#xA;The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are&#xA;governed by the terms of this License. You represent that You believe&#xA;Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You have&#xA;sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.&#xA;&#xA;3.3. Required Notices.  You must include a notice in each of Your&#xA;Modifications that identifies You as the Contributor of the&#xA;Modification.

Application of Additional Terms.  You may not offer or impose any&#xA;terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form that alters or&#xA;restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients&#xA;rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,&#xA;warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more&#xA;recipients of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your&#xA;own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any&#xA;Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty,&#xA;support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone,&#xA;and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every&#xA;Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or&#xA;such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or&#xA;liability terms You offer.&#xA;&#xA;3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.  You may distribute the&#xA;Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms of this&#xA;License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may&#xA;contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in&#xA;compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the&#xA;Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients&#xA;rights in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this&#xA;License. If You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form&#xA;under a different license, You must make it absolutely clear that any&#xA;terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by&#xA;the Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify&#xA;the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred&#xA;by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such&#xA;terms You offer.&#xA;&#xA;3.6. Larger Works.  You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered&#xA;Software with other code not governed by the terms of this License and&#xA;distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You&#xA;must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the&#xA;Covered Software.&#xA;&#xA;4. Versions of the License.&#xA;&#xA;4.1. New Versions.  Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license&#xA;steward and may publish revised and/or new versions of this License&#xA;from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version&#xA;number. Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than the&#xA;license steward has the right to modify this License.&#xA;&#xA;4.2. Effect of New Versions.&#xA;&#xA;You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the&#xA;Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the&#xA;License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If&#xA;the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software&#xA;prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available&#xA;under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and&#xA;make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of&#xA;the License under which You originally received the Covered&#xA;Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or&#xA;otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any&#xA;subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.&#xA;4.3. Modified Versions.&#xA;&#xA;When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license&#xA;for Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version&#xA;of this License if You: (a)Ã¡rename the license and remove any&#xA;references to the name of the license steward (except to note that the&#xA;license differs from this License); and (b)Ã¡otherwise make it clear&#xA;that the license contains terms which differ from this License.&#xA;&#xA;5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.&#xA;&#xA;COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN AS IS BASIS,&#xA;WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,&#xA;WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF&#xA;DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR&#xA;NON-INFRINGING.

Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect&#xA;beyond the termination of this License shall survive.&#xA;&#xA;6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory&#xA;judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the&#xA;Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such&#xA;claim is referred to as Participant) alleging that the&#xA;Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the&#xA;Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the&#xA;Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly&#xA;infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or&#xA;indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if&#xA;the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all&#xA;Contributors under SectionsÃ¡2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall,&#xA;upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and&#xA;automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice period,&#xA;unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with&#xA;respect to the Participant Software against such Participant&#xA;either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with&#xA;Participant.&#xA;&#xA;6.3. In the event of termination under SectionsÃ¡6.1 or 6.2 above, all&#xA;end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any&#xA;distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses&#xA;granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.&#xA;&#xA;7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.&#xA;&#xA;UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT&#xA;(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL&#xA;DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED&#xA;SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY&#xA;PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES&#xA;OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST&#xA;PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR&#xA;MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN&#xA;IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH&#xA;DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR&#xA;DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTYS NEGLIGENCE TO THE&#xA;EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO&#xA;NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL&#xA;DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.&#xA;&#xA;8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.&#xA;&#xA;The Covered Software is a commercial item, as that term is defined in&#xA;48Ã¡C.F.R.Ã¡2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of commercial computer&#xA;software (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. Ã¡252.227-7014(a)(1))&#xA;and commercial computer software documentation as such terms are used&#xA;in 48Ã¡C.F.R.Ã¡12.212 (Sept. 1995).

This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu&#xA;of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision&#xA;that addresses Government rights in computer software under this&#xA;License.&#xA;&#xA;9. MISCELLANEOUS.&#xA;&#xA;This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject&#xA;matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be&#xA;unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent&#xA;necessary to make it enforceable.

ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE &#xA;PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT&apos;S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;1. DEFINITIONS &#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contribution&quot; means: &#xA;&#xA;a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and &#xA;documentation distributed under this Agreement, and&#xA;&#xA;b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:&#xA;&#xA;i) changes to the Program, and&#xA;&#xA;ii) additions to the Program;&#xA;&#xA;where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are &#xA;distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution &apos;originates&apos; &#xA;from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor &#xA;itself or anyone acting on such Contributor&apos;s behalf. Contributions do not &#xA;include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of &#xA;software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own &#xA;license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program. &#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contributor&quot; means any person or entity that distributes the Program. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Licensed Patents &quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which &#xA;are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or &#xA;when combined with the Program. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Program&quot; means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this &#xA;Agreement. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, &#xA;including all Contributors. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;2. GRANT OF RIGHTS &#xA;&#xA;a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants &#xA;Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to &#xA;reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly &#xA;perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, &#xA;if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.&#xA;&#xA;b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants &#xA;Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under &#xA;Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise &#xA;transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and &#xA;object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the &#xA;Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by &#xA;the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination &#xA;to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply &#xA;to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se &#xA;is licensed hereunder. &#xA;&#xA;c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses &#xA;to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any &#xA;Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other &#xA;intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims &#xA;any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on &#xA;infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to &#xA;exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby &#xA;assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights &#xA;needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to &#xA;allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient&apos;s responsibility &#xA;to acquire that license before distributing the Program.&#xA;&#xA;d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient &#xA;copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license &#xA;set forth in this Agreement.&#xA;&#xA;3. REQUIREMENTS &#xA;&#xA;A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under &#xA;its own license agreement, provided that: &#xA;&#xA;a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and&#xA;&#xA;b) its license agreement:&#xA;&#xA;i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and &#xA;conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title &#xA;and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability &#xA;and fitness for a particular purpose; &#xA;&#xA;ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for &#xA;damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential &#xA;damages, such as lost profits; &#xA;&#xA;iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered &#xA;by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and&#xA;&#xA;iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such &#xA;Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on &#xA;or through a medium customarily used for software exchange. &#xA;&#xA;When the Program is made available in source code form: &#xA;&#xA;a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and &#xA;&#xA;b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program. &#xA;&#xA;Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within &#xA;the Program. &#xA;&#xA;Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its &#xA;Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent &#xA;Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution. &#xA;&#xA;4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION &#xA;&#xA;Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities &#xA;with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this &#xA;license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the &#xA;Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering &#xA;should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for &#xA;other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a &#xA;commercial product offering, such Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;) &#xA;hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (&quot;Indemnified &#xA;Contributor&quot;) against any losses, damages and costs (collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) &#xA;arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third &#xA;party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts &#xA;or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its &#xA;distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The &#xA;obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating &#xA;to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to &#xA;qualify, &#xA;an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial &#xA;Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial &#xA;Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, &#xA;the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified &#xA;Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial &#xA;product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial &#xA;Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, &#xA;or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and &#xA;warranties are such Commercial Contributor&apos;s responsibility alone. Under &#xA;this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims &#xA;against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and &#xA;warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any &#xA;damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;5. NO WARRANTY &#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED &#xA;ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER &#xA;EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR &#xA;CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A &#xA;PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining &#xA;the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all &#xA;risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, &#xA;including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, &#xA;compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or &#xA;equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY &#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY &#xA;CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, &#xA;SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION &#xA;LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN &#xA;CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) &#xA;ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE &#xA;EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE &#xA;POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;7. GENERAL &#xA;&#xA;If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under &#xA;applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of &#xA;the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action &#xA;by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum &#xA;extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with &#xA;respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or &#xA;counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that &#xA;Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as &#xA;of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient &#xA;institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim &#xA;or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding &#xA;combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes &#xA;such Recipient&apos;s patent(s), then such Recipient&apos;s rights granted under &#xA;Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;All Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails &#xA;to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement &#xA;and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after &#xA;becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient&apos;s rights under this &#xA;Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the &#xA;Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient&apos;s obligations &#xA;under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the &#xA;Program shall continue and survive. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, &#xA;but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may &#xA;only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves &#xA;the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement &#xA;from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right &#xA;to modify this Agreement. IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may &#xA;assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable &#xA;separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a &#xA;distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may &#xA;always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which &#xA;it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is &#xA;published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its &#xA;Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in &#xA;Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to &#xA;the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether &#xA;expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program &#xA;not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the &#xA;intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this &#xA;Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year &#xA;after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury &#xA;trial in any resulting litigation. &#xA;&#xA;'/>

For example, if a third party patent license is required to &#xA;allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient&apos;s responsibility &#xA;to acquire that license before distributing the Program.&#xA;&#xA;d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient &#xA;copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license &#xA;set forth in this Agreement.&#xA;&#xA;3. REQUIREMENTS &#xA;&#xA;A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under &#xA;its own license agreement, provided that: &#xA;&#xA;a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and&#xA;&#xA;b) its license agreement:&#xA;&#xA;i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and &#xA;conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title &#xA;and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability &#xA;and fitness for a particular purpose; &#xA;&#xA;ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for &#xA;damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential &#xA;damages, such as lost profits; &#xA;&#xA;iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered &#xA;by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and&#xA;&#xA;iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such &#xA;Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on &#xA;or through a medium customarily used for software exchange. &#xA;&#xA;When the Program is made available in source code form: &#xA;&#xA;a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and &#xA;&#xA;b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program. &#xA;&#xA;Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within &#xA;the Program. &#xA;&#xA;Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its &#xA;Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent &#xA;Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution. &#xA;&#xA;4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION &#xA;&#xA;Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities &#xA;with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this &#xA;license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the &#xA;Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering &#xA;should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for &#xA;other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a &#xA;commercial product offering, such Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;) &#xA;hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (&quot;Indemnified &#xA;Contributor&quot;) against any losses, damages and costs (collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) &#xA;arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third &#xA;party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts &#xA;or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its &#xA;distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The &#xA;obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating &#xA;to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to &#xA;qualify, &#xA;an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial &#xA;Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial &#xA;Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, &#xA;the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified &#xA;Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial &#xA;product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial &#xA;Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, &#xA;or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and &#xA;warranties are such Commercial Contributor&apos;s responsibility alone. Under &#xA;this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims &#xA;against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and &#xA;warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any &#xA;damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;5. NO WARRANTY &#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED &#xA;ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER &#xA;EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR &#xA;CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A &#xA;PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining &#xA;the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all &#xA;risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, &#xA;including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, &#xA;compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or &#xA;equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY &#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY &#xA;CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, &#xA;SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION &#xA;LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN &#xA;CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) &#xA;ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE &#xA;EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE &#xA;POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;7. GENERAL &#xA;&#xA;If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under &#xA;applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of &#xA;the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action &#xA;by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum &#xA;extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with &#xA;respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or &#xA;counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that &#xA;Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as &#xA;of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient &#xA;institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim &#xA;or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding &#xA;combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes &#xA;such Recipient&apos;s patent(s), then such Recipient&apos;s rights granted under &#xA;Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;All Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails &#xA;to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement &#xA;and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after &#xA;becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient&apos;s rights under this &#xA;Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the &#xA;Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient&apos;s obligations &#xA;under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the &#xA;Program shall continue and survive. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, &#xA;but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may &#xA;only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves &#xA;the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement &#xA;from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right &#xA;to modify this Agreement. IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may &#xA;assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable &#xA;separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a &#xA;distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may &#xA;always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which &#xA;it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is &#xA;published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its &#xA;Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in &#xA;Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to &#xA;the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether &#xA;expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program &#xA;not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the &#xA;intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this &#xA;Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year &#xA;after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury &#xA;trial in any resulting litigation. &#xA;'/>

Distribution Obligations.&#xA;&#xA;3.1. Availability of Source Code.&#xA;&#xA;Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available&#xA;in Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form and&#xA;that Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms of this&#xA;License. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of&#xA;the Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or&#xA;otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any such&#xA;Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can obtain such&#xA;Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or&#xA;through a medium customarily used for software exchange.&#xA;&#xA;3.2. Modifications.&#xA;&#xA;The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are&#xA;governed by the terms of this License. You represent that You believe&#xA;Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You have&#xA;sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.&#xA;&#xA;3.3. Required Notices.  You must include a notice in each of Your&#xA;Modifications that identifies You as the Contributor of the&#xA;Modification. You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or&#xA;trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, or any&#xA;notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving attribution to any&#xA;Contributor or the Initial Developer.&#xA;&#xA;3.4. Application of Additional Terms.  You may not offer or impose any&#xA;terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form that alters or&#xA;restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients&#xA;rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,&#xA;warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more&#xA;recipients of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your&#xA;own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any&#xA;Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty,&#xA;support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone,&#xA;and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every&#xA;Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or&#xA;such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or&#xA;liability terms You offer.&#xA;&#xA;3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.  You may distribute the&#xA;Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms of this&#xA;License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may&#xA;contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in&#xA;compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the&#xA;Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients&#xA;rights in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this&#xA;License. If You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form&#xA;under a different license, You must make it absolutely clear that any&#xA;terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by&#xA;the Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify&#xA;the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred&#xA;by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such&#xA;terms You offer.&#xA;&#xA;3.6. Larger Works.  You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered&#xA;Software with other code not governed by the terms of this License and&#xA;distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You&#xA;must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the&#xA;Covered Software.&#xA;&#xA;4. Versions of the License.&#xA;&#xA;4.1. New Versions.  Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license&#xA;steward and may publish revised and/or new versions of this License&#xA;from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version&#xA;number. Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than the&#xA;license steward has the right to modify this License.&#xA;&#xA;4.2. Effect of New Versions.&#xA;&#xA;You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the&#xA;Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the&#xA;License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If&#xA;the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software&#xA;prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available&#xA;under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and&#xA;make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of&#xA;the License under which You originally received the Covered&#xA;Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or&#xA;otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any&#xA;subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.&#xA;4.3. Modified Versions.&#xA;&#xA;When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license&#xA;for Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version&#xA;of this License if You: (a)Ã¡rename the license and remove any&#xA;references to the name of the license steward (except to note that the&#xA;license differs from this License); and (b)Ã¡otherwise make it clear&#xA;that the license contains terms which differ from this License.&#xA;&#xA;5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.&#xA;&#xA;COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN AS IS BASIS,&#xA;WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,&#xA;WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF&#xA;DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR&#xA;NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF&#xA;THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE&#xA;DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER&#xA;CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR&#xA;CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART&#xA;OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED&#xA;HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.&#xA;&#xA;6. TERMINATION.&#xA;&#xA;6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate&#xA;automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to&#xA;cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the&#xA;breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect&#xA;beyond the termination of this License shall survive.&#xA;&#xA;6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory&#xA;judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the&#xA;Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such&#xA;claim is referred to as Participant) alleging that the&#xA;Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the&#xA;Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the&#xA;Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly&#xA;infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or&#xA;indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if&#xA;the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all&#xA;Contributors under SectionsÃ¡2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall,&#xA;upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and&#xA;automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice period,&#xA;unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with&#xA;respect to the Participant Software against such Participant&#xA;either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with&#xA;Participant.&#xA;&#xA;6.3. In the event of termination under SectionsÃ¡6.1 or 6.2 above, all&#xA;end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any&#xA;distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses&#xA;granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.&#xA;&#xA;7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.&#xA;&#xA;UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT&#xA;(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL&#xA;DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED&#xA;SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY&#xA;PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES&#xA;OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST&#xA;PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR&#xA;MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN&#xA;IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH&#xA;DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR&#xA;DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTYS NEGLIGENCE TO THE&#xA;EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO&#xA;NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL&#xA;DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.&#xA;&#xA;8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.&#xA;&#xA;The Covered Software is a commercial item, as that term is defined in&#xA;48Ã¡C.F.R.Ã¡2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of commercial computer&#xA;software (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. Ã¡252.227-7014(a)(1))&#xA;and commercial computer software documentation as such terms are used&#xA;in 48Ã¡C.F.R.Ã¡12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and&#xA;48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all&#xA;U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only those&#xA;rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu&#xA;of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision&#xA;that addresses Government rights in computer software under this&#xA;License.&#xA;&#xA;9. MISCELLANEOUS.&#xA;&#xA;This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject&#xA;matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be&#xA;unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent&#xA;necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by&#xA;the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within the&#xA;Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any,&#xA;provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdictions conflict-of-law&#xA;provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject&#xA;to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and&#xA;venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software,&#xA;with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without&#xA;limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and&#xA;expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on&#xA;Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly&#xA;excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a&#xA;contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to&#xA;this License. You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance&#xA;with the United States export administration regulations (and the&#xA;export control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You&#xA;use, distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.&#xA;&#xA;10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.&#xA;&#xA;As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is&#xA;responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,&#xA;out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to&#xA;work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such&#xA;responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or&#xA;shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.&#xA;&#xA;NOTICE PURSUANT TO SECTION 9 OF THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND&#xA;DISTRIBUTION LICENSE (CDDL) The GlassFish code released under the CDDL&#xA;shall be governed by the laws of the State of California (excluding&#xA;conflict-of-law provisions). Any litigation relating to this License&#xA;shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the&#xA;Northern District of California and the state courts of the State of&#xA;California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California.&#xA;&#xA;For plexus-archiver-1.0-alpha-7.jar:&#xA;&#xA;=========================================================================&#xA;==  Plexus License                                                     ==&#xA;=========================================================================&#xA;&#xA;Common Public License - v 1.0 &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON &#xA;PUBLIC LICENSE (&quot;AGREEMENT&quot;). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE &#xA;PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT&apos;S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;1. DEFINITIONS &#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contribution&quot; means: &#xA;&#xA;a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and &#xA;documentation distributed under this Agreement, and&#xA;&#xA;b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:&#xA;&#xA;i) changes to the Program, and&#xA;&#xA;ii) additions to the Program;&#xA;&#xA;where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are &#xA;distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution &apos;originates&apos; &#xA;from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor &#xA;itself or anyone acting on such Contributor&apos;s behalf. Contributions do not &#xA;include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of &#xA;software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own &#xA;license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program. &#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contributor&quot; means any person or entity that distributes the Program. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Licensed Patents &quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which &#xA;are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or &#xA;when combined with the Program. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Program&quot; means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this &#xA;Agreement. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, &#xA;including all Contributors. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;2. GRANT OF RIGHTS &#xA;&#xA;a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants &#xA;Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to &#xA;reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly &#xA;perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, &#xA;if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.&#xA;&#xA;b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants &#xA;Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under &#xA;Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise &#xA;transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and &#xA;object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the &#xA;Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by &#xA;the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination &#xA;to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply &#xA;to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se &#xA;is licensed hereunder. &#xA;&#xA;c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses &#xA;to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any &#xA;Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other &#xA;intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims &#xA;any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on &#xA;infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to &#xA;exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby &#xA;assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights &#xA;needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to &#xA;allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient&apos;s responsibility &#xA;to acquire that license before distributing the Program.&#xA;&#xA;d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient &#xA;copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license &#xA;set forth in this Agreement.&#xA;&#xA;3. REQUIREMENTS &#xA;&#xA;A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under &#xA;its own license agreement, provided that: &#xA;&#xA;a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and&#xA;&#xA;b) its license agreement:&#xA;&#xA;i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and &#xA;conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title &#xA;and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability &#xA;and fitness for a particular purpose; &#xA;&#xA;ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for &#xA;damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential &#xA;damages, such as lost profits; &#xA;&#xA;iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered &#xA;by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and&#xA;&#xA;iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such &#xA;Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on &#xA;or through a medium customarily used for software exchange. &#xA;&#xA;When the Program is made available in source code form: &#xA;&#xA;a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and &#xA;&#xA;b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program. &#xA;&#xA;Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within &#xA;the Program. &#xA;&#xA;Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its &#xA;Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent &#xA;Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution. &#xA;&#xA;4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION &#xA;&#xA;Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities &#xA;with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this &#xA;license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the &#xA;Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering &#xA;should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for &#xA;other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a &#xA;commercial product offering, such Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;) &#xA;hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (&quot;Indemnified &#xA;Contributor&quot;) against any losses, damages and costs (collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) &#xA;arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third &#xA;party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts &#xA;or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its &#xA;distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The &#xA;obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating &#xA;to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to &#xA;qualify, &#xA;an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial &#xA;Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial &#xA;Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, &#xA;the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified &#xA;Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial &#xA;product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial &#xA;Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, &#xA;or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and &#xA;warranties are such Commercial Contributor&apos;s responsibility alone. Under &#xA;this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims &#xA;against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and &#xA;warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any &#xA;damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;5. NO WARRANTY &#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED &#xA;ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER &#xA;EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR &#xA;CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A &#xA;PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining &#xA;the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all &#xA;risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, &#xA;including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, &#xA;compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or &#xA;equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY &#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY &#xA;CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, &#xA;SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION &#xA;LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN &#xA;CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) &#xA;ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE &#xA;EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE &#xA;POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;7. GENERAL &#xA;&#xA;If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under &#xA;applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of &#xA;the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action &#xA;by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum &#xA;extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with &#xA;respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or &#xA;counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that &#xA;Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as &#xA;of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient &#xA;institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim &#xA;or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding &#xA;combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes &#xA;such Recipient&apos;s patent(s), then such Recipient&apos;s rights granted under &#xA;Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;All Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails &#xA;to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement &#xA;and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after &#xA;becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient&apos;s rights under this &#xA;Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the &#xA;Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient&apos;s obligations &#xA;under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the &#xA;Program shall continue and survive. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, &#xA;but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may &#xA;only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves &#xA;the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement &#xA;from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right &#xA;to modify this Agreement. IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may &#xA;assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable &#xA;separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a &#xA;distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may &#xA;always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which &#xA;it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is &#xA;published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its &#xA;Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in &#xA;Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to &#xA;the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether &#xA;expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program &#xA;not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the &#xA;intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this &#xA;Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year &#xA;after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury &#xA;trial in any resulting litigation. &#xA;&#xA;'/>

Distribution Obligations.&#xA;&#xA;3.1. Availability of Source Code.&#xA;&#xA;Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available&#xA;in Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form and&#xA;that Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms of this&#xA;License. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of&#xA;the Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or&#xA;otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any such&#xA;Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can obtain such&#xA;Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or&#xA;through a medium customarily used for software exchange.&#xA;&#xA;3.2. Modifications.&#xA;&#xA;The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are&#xA;governed by the terms of this License. You represent that You believe&#xA;Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You have&#xA;sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.&#xA;&#xA;3.3. Required Notices.  You must include a notice in each of Your&#xA;Modifications that identifies You as the Contributor of the&#xA;Modification. You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or&#xA;trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, or any&#xA;notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving attribution to any&#xA;Contributor or the Initial Developer.&#xA;&#xA;3.4. Application of Additional Terms.  You may not offer or impose any&#xA;terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form that alters or&#xA;restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients&#xA;rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,&#xA;warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more&#xA;recipients of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your&#xA;own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any&#xA;Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty,&#xA;support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone,&#xA;and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every&#xA;Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or&#xA;such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or&#xA;liability terms You offer.&#xA;&#xA;3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.  You may distribute the&#xA;Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms of this&#xA;License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may&#xA;contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in&#xA;compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the&#xA;Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients&#xA;rights in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this&#xA;License. If You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form&#xA;under a different license, You must make it absolutely clear that any&#xA;terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by&#xA;the Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify&#xA;the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred&#xA;by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such&#xA;terms You offer.&#xA;&#xA;3.6. Larger Works.  You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered&#xA;Software with other code not governed by the terms of this License and&#xA;distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You&#xA;must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the&#xA;Covered Software.&#xA;&#xA;4. Versions of the License.&#xA;&#xA;4.1. New Versions.  Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license&#xA;steward and may publish revised and/or new versions of this License&#xA;from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version&#xA;number. Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than the&#xA;license steward has the right to modify this License.&#xA;&#xA;4.2. Effect of New Versions.&#xA;&#xA;You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the&#xA;Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the&#xA;License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If&#xA;the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software&#xA;prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available&#xA;under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and&#xA;make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of&#xA;the License under which You originally received the Covered&#xA;Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or&#xA;otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any&#xA;subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.&#xA;4.3. Modified Versions.&#xA;&#xA;When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license&#xA;for Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version&#xA;of this License if You: (a)Ã¡rename the license and remove any&#xA;references to the name of the license steward (except to note that the&#xA;license differs from this License); and (b)Ã¡otherwise make it clear&#xA;that the license contains terms which differ from this License.&#xA;&#xA;5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.&#xA;&#xA;COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN AS IS BASIS,&#xA;WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,&#xA;WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF&#xA;DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR&#xA;NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF&#xA;THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE&#xA;DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER&#xA;CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR&#xA;CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART&#xA;OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED&#xA;HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.&#xA;&#xA;6. TERMINATION.&#xA;&#xA;6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate&#xA;automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to&#xA;cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the&#xA;breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect&#xA;beyond the termination of this License shall survive.&#xA;&#xA;6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory&#xA;judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the&#xA;Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such&#xA;claim is referred to as Participant) alleging that the&#xA;Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the&#xA;Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the&#xA;Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly&#xA;infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or&#xA;indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if&#xA;the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all&#xA;Contributors under SectionsÃ¡2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall,&#xA;upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and&#xA;automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice period,&#xA;unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with&#xA;respect to the Participant Software against such Participant&#xA;either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with&#xA;Participant.&#xA;&#xA;6.3. In the event of termination under SectionsÃ¡6.1 or 6.2 above, all&#xA;end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any&#xA;distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses&#xA;granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.&#xA;&#xA;7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.&#xA;&#xA;UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT&#xA;(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL&#xA;DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED&#xA;SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY&#xA;PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES&#xA;OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST&#xA;PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR&#xA;MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN&#xA;IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH&#xA;DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR&#xA;DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTYS NEGLIGENCE TO THE&#xA;EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO&#xA;NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL&#xA;DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.&#xA;&#xA;8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.&#xA;&#xA;The Covered Software is a commercial item, as that term is defined in&#xA;48Ã¡C.F.R.Ã¡2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of commercial computer&#xA;software (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. Ã¡252.227-7014(a)(1))&#xA;and commercial computer software documentation as such terms are used&#xA;in 48Ã¡C.F.R.Ã¡12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and&#xA;48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all&#xA;U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only those&#xA;rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu&#xA;of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision&#xA;that addresses Government rights in computer software under this&#xA;License.&#xA;&#xA;9. MISCELLANEOUS.&#xA;&#xA;This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject&#xA;matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be&#xA;unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent&#xA;necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by&#xA;the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within the&#xA;Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any,&#xA;provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdictions conflict-of-law&#xA;provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject&#xA;to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and&#xA;venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software,&#xA;with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without&#xA;limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and&#xA;expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on&#xA;Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly&#xA;excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a&#xA;contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to&#xA;this License. You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance&#xA;with the United States export administration regulations (and the&#xA;export control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You&#xA;use, distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.&#xA;&#xA;10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.&#xA;&#xA;As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is&#xA;responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,&#xA;out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to&#xA;work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such&#xA;responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or&#xA;shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.&#xA;&#xA;NOTICE PURSUANT TO SECTION 9 OF THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND&#xA;DISTRIBUTION LICENSE (CDDL) The GlassFish code released under the CDDL&#xA;shall be governed by the laws of the State of California (excluding&#xA;conflict-of-law provisions). Any litigation relating to this License&#xA;shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the&#xA;Northern District of California and the state courts of the State of&#xA;California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California.&#xA;&#xA;For plexus-archiver jar:&#xA;&#xA;=========================================================================&#xA;==  Plexus License                                                     ==&#xA;=========================================================================&#xA;&#xA;Common Public License - v 1.0 &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON &#xA;PUBLIC LICENSE (&quot;AGREEMENT&quot;). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE &#xA;PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT&apos;S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;1. DEFINITIONS &#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contribution&quot; means: &#xA;&#xA;a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and &#xA;documentation distributed under this Agreement, and&#xA;&#xA;b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:&#xA;&#xA;i) changes to the Program, and&#xA;&#xA;ii) additions to the Program;&#xA;&#xA;where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are &#xA;distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution &apos;originates&apos; &#xA;from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor &#xA;itself or anyone acting on such Contributor&apos;s behalf. Contributions do not &#xA;include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of &#xA;software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own &#xA;license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program. &#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contributor&quot; means any person or entity that distributes the Program. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Licensed Patents &quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which &#xA;are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or &#xA;when combined with the Program. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Program&quot; means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this &#xA;Agreement. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, &#xA;including all Contributors. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;2. GRANT OF RIGHTS &#xA;&#xA;a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants &#xA;Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to &#xA;reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly &#xA;perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, &#xA;if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.&#xA;&#xA;b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants &#xA;Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under &#xA;Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise &#xA;transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and &#xA;object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the &#xA;Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by &#xA;the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination &#xA;to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply &#xA;to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se &#xA;is licensed hereunder. &#xA;&#xA;c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses &#xA;to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any &#xA;Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other &#xA;intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims &#xA;any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on &#xA;infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to &#xA;exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby &#xA;assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights &#xA;needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to &#xA;allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient&apos;s responsibility &#xA;to acquire that license before distributing the Program.&#xA;&#xA;d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient &#xA;copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license &#xA;set forth in this Agreement.&#xA;&#xA;3. REQUIREMENTS &#xA;&#xA;A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under &#xA;its own license agreement, provided that: &#xA;&#xA;a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and&#xA;&#xA;b) its license agreement:&#xA;&#xA;i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and &#xA;conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title &#xA;and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability &#xA;and fitness for a particular purpose; &#xA;&#xA;ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for &#xA;damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential &#xA;damages, such as lost profits; &#xA;&#xA;iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered &#xA;by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and&#xA;&#xA;iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such &#xA;Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on &#xA;or through a medium customarily used for software exchange. &#xA;&#xA;When the Program is made available in source code form: &#xA;&#xA;a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and &#xA;&#xA;b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program. &#xA;&#xA;Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within &#xA;the Program. &#xA;&#xA;Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its &#xA;Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent &#xA;Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution. &#xA;&#xA;4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION &#xA;&#xA;Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities &#xA;with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this &#xA;license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the &#xA;Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering &#xA;should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for &#xA;other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a &#xA;commercial product offering, such Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;) &#xA;hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (&quot;Indemnified &#xA;Contributor&quot;) against any losses, damages and costs (collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) &#xA;arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third &#xA;party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts &#xA;or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its &#xA;distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The &#xA;obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating &#xA;to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to &#xA;qualify, &#xA;an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial &#xA;Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial &#xA;Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, &#xA;the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified &#xA;Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial &#xA;product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial &#xA;Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, &#xA;or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and &#xA;warranties are such Commercial Contributor&apos;s responsibility alone. Under &#xA;this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims &#xA;against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and &#xA;warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any &#xA;damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;5. NO WARRANTY &#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED &#xA;ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER &#xA;EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR &#xA;CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A &#xA;PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining &#xA;the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all &#xA;risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, &#xA;including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, &#xA;compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or &#xA;equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY &#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY &#xA;CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, &#xA;SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION &#xA;LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN &#xA;CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) &#xA;ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE &#xA;EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE &#xA;POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;7. GENERAL &#xA;&#xA;If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under &#xA;applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of &#xA;the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action &#xA;by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum &#xA;extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with &#xA;respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or &#xA;counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that &#xA;Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as &#xA;of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient &#xA;institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim &#xA;or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding &#xA;combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes &#xA;such Recipient&apos;s patent(s), then such Recipient&apos;s rights granted under &#xA;Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;All Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails &#xA;to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement &#xA;and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after &#xA;becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient&apos;s rights under this &#xA;Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the &#xA;Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient&apos;s obligations &#xA;under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the &#xA;Program shall continue and survive. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, &#xA;but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may &#xA;only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves &#xA;the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement &#xA;from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right &#xA;to modify this Agreement. IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may &#xA;assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable &#xA;separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a &#xA;distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may &#xA;always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which &#xA;it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is &#xA;published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its &#xA;Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in &#xA;Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to &#xA;the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether &#xA;expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program &#xA;not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the &#xA;intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this &#xA;Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year &#xA;after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury &#xA;trial in any resulting litigation. &#xA;&#xA;'/>
