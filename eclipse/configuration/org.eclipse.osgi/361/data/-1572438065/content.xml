IF YOU ARE ACCEPTING THESE TERMS ON BEHALF OF LICENSEE, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE FULL AUTHORITY TO BIND LICENSEE TO THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS,&#xA;&#xA;* DO NOT DOWNLOAD, INSTALL, COPY, ACCESS, CLICK ON AN &quot;ACCEPT&quot; BUTTON, OR USE THE PROGRAM; AND&#xA;&#xA;* PROMPTLY RETURN THE UNUSED MEDIA AND DOCUMENTATION TO IBM. IF THE PROGRAM WAS DOWNLOADED, DESTROY ALL COPIES OF THE PROGRAM.&#xA;&#xA;1. Definitions&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Authorized Use&quot; - the specified level at which Licensee is authorized to execute or run the Program. That level may be measured by number of users, millions of service units (&quot;MSUs&quot;), Processor Value Units (&quot;PVUs&quot;), or other level of use specified by IBM.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Early Release&quot; - a release of a Program for purposes of testing prior to it being made commercially available that may still be under development and therefore, potentially unreliable.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;IBM&quot; - International Business Machines Corporation or one of its subsidiaries.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;License Information&quot; (&quot;LI&quot;) - a document that provides information and any additional terms specific to a Program. The Program&apos;s LI can be found in the Program&apos;s directory, by the use of a system command, or as a booklet included with the Program.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Program&quot; - the following, including the original and all whole or partial copies: 1) machine-readable instructions and data, 2) components, files, and modules, 3) audio-visual content (such as images, text, recordings, or pictures), and 4) related licensed materials (such as keys and documentation).&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Test Period&quot; - the period during which the Licensee tests a Program that has not been made commercially available to customers.&#xA;&#xA;2. Agreement Structure&#xA;&#xA;This Agreement includes Part 1 - General Terms, Part 2 - Country-unique Terms (if any) and the LI and is the complete agreement between Licensee and IBM regarding the use of the Program. It replaces any prior oral or written communications between Licensee and IBM concerning Licensee&apos;s use of the Program. The terms of Part 2 may replace or modify those of Part 1. To the extent of any conflict, the LI prevails over both Parts.&#xA;&#xA;3. License Grant&#xA;&#xA;The Program is owned by IBM or an IBM supplier, and is copyrighted and licensed, not sold.&#xA;&#xA;IBM grants Licensee a limited, nonexclusive, nontransferable license to 1) download, install, and use the Program during the Test Period up to the Authorized Use specified in the LI solely for test purposes and to provide feedback to IBM and 2) make a backup copy, all provided that&#xA;&#xA;a. Licensee has lawfully obtained the Program and complies with the terms of this Agreement;&#xA;&#xA;b. the backup copy does not execute unless the backed-up Program cannot execute;&#xA;&#xA;c. Licensee reproduces all copyright notices and other legends of ownership on each copy, or partial copy, of the Program;&#xA;&#xA;d. Licensee maintains a record of all copies of the Program and ensures that anyone who uses the Program (accessed either locally or remotely) 1) does so only on Licensee&apos;s behalf and 2) complies with the terms of this Agreement;&#xA;&#xA;e. Licensee does not 1) use the Program for productive purposes or otherwise use, copy, modify, or distribute the Program except as expressly permitted in this Agreement; 2) reverse assemble, reverse compile, otherwise translate, or reverse engineer the Program, except as expressly permitted by law without the possibility of contractual waiver; 3) use any of the Program&apos;s components, files, modules, audio-visual content, or related licensed materials separately from that Program; 4) sublicense, rent, or lease the Program; or 5) use the Program for commercial application hosting; and&#xA;&#xA;f. if Licensee obtains this Program as a Supporting Program, Licensee uses this Program only to support the Principal Program and subject to any limitations in the license to the Principal Program, or, if Licensee obtains this Program as a Principal Program, Licensee uses all Supporting Programs only to support this Program, and subject to any limitations in this Agreement. For purposes of this Item &quot;f,&quot; a &quot;Supporting Program&quot; is a Program that is part of another IBM Program (&quot;Principal Program&quot;) and identified as a Supporting Program in the Principal Program&apos;s LI. (To obtain a separate license to a Supporting Program without these restrictions, Licensee should contact the party from whom Licensee obtained the Supporting Program.)&#xA;&#xA;This license applies to each copy of the Program that Licensee makes.&#xA;&#xA;3.1 Updates, Fixes, and Patches&#xA;&#xA;When Licensee receives an update, fix, or patch to a Program, Licensee accepts any additional or different terms that are applicable to such update, fix, or patch that are specified in its LI. If no additional or different terms are provided, then the update, fix, or patch is subject solely to this Agreement. If the Program is replaced by an update, Licensee agrees to promptly discontinue use of the replaced Program.&#xA;&#xA;3.2 Term and Termination&#xA;&#xA;The Test Period begins on the date Licensee agrees to the terms of this Agreement and ends upon the earliest of 1) the end of the duration or the date specified by IBM in either the License Information or a transaction document, 2) the date on which the Program automatically disables itself, or 3) the date on which IBM makes the Program commercially available. Licensee&apos;s license to the Program terminates at the end of the Test Period, and Licensee agrees to promptly discontinue use of the Program and destroy all of Licensee&apos;s copies of the Program within 10 days of the end of the Test Period.&#xA;&#xA;IBM may terminate Licensee&apos;s license if Licensee fails to comply with the terms of this Agreement. If the license is terminated for any reason by either party, Licensee agrees to promptly discontinue use of and destroy all of Licensee&apos;s copies of the Program.&#xA;&#xA;THE PROGRAM MAY CONTAIN A DISABLING DEVICE THAT WILL PREVENT IT FROM BEING USED AFTER THE TEST PERIOD ENDS. LICENSEE AGREES NOT TO TAMPER WITH THE DISABLING DEVICE OR THE PROGRAM. LICENSEE SHOULD TAKE PRECAUTIONS TO AVOID ANY LOSS OF DATA THAT MIGHT RESULT WHEN THE PROGRAM CAN NO LONGER BE USED.&#xA;&#xA;4. Charges&#xA;&#xA;There is no charge for the use of the Program for the duration of the Test Period.&#xA;&#xA;5. Rights in Data&#xA;&#xA;Licensee assigns to IBM all right, title, and interest (including ownership of copyright) in any data, suggestions, or written materials that 1) are related to the Program and 2) Licensee provides to IBM. Upon IBM&apos;s request, Licensee will sign additional documents necessary to assign such rights. In addition to the foregoing, Licensee grants to IBM a non-exclusive, irrevocable, unrestricted, worldwide and paid-up right and license to a) include in any product or service any idea, know-how, concept, technique, invention, discovery or improvement, whether or not patentable, that Licensee provides to IBM related to the Program b) use, manufacture and market any such product or service, and c) allow others to do any of the foregoing.&#xA;&#xA;6. No Warranties&#xA;&#xA;SUBJECT TO ANY STATUTORY WARRANTIES THAT CANNOT BE EXCLUDED, IBM MAKES NO WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, REGARDING THE PROGRAM OR SUPPORT, IF ANY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND TITLE, AND ANY WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF NON-INFRINGEMENT.&#xA;&#xA;SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO LICENSEE. IN THAT EVENT, SUCH WARRANTIES ARE LIMITED IN DURATION TO THE MINIMUM PERIOD REQUIRED BY LAW. NO WARRANTIES APPLY AFTER THAT PERIOD. SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO LICENSEE. LICENSEE MAY HAVE OTHER RIGHTS THAT VARY FROM STATE TO STATE OR JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION.&#xA;&#xA;THE DISCLAIMERS AND EXCLUSIONS IN THIS SECTION 6 ALSO APPLY TO ANY OF IBM&apos;S PROGRAM DEVELOPERS AND SUPPLIERS.&#xA;&#xA;MANUFACTURERS, SUPPLIERS, OR PUBLISHERS OF NON-IBM PROGRAMS MAY PROVIDE THEIR OWN WARRANTIES.&#xA;&#xA;IBM DOES NOT PROVIDE SUPPORT OF ANY KIND, UNLESS IBM SPECIFIES OTHERWISE. IN SUCH EVENT, ANY SUPPORT PROVIDED BY IBM IS SUBJECT TO THE DISCLAIMERS AND EXCLUSIONS IN THIS SECTION 6.&#xA;&#xA;7. Licensee Data and Databases&#xA;&#xA;To assist Licensee in isolating the cause of a problem with the Program, IBM may request that Licensee 1) allow IBM to remotely access Licensee&apos;s system or 2) send Licensee information or system data to IBM. However, IBM is not obligated to provide such assistance unless IBM and Licensee enter a separate written agreement under which IBM agrees to provide to Licensee that type of support, which is beyond IBM&apos;s obligations in this Agreement. In any event, IBM uses information about errors and problems to improve its products and services, and assist with its provision of related support offerings. For these purposes, IBM may use IBM entities and subcontractors (including in one or more countries other than the one in which Licensee is located), and Licensee authorizes IBM to do so.&#xA;&#xA;Licensee remains responsible for 1) any data and the content of any database Licensee makes available to IBM, 2) the selection and implementation of procedures and controls regarding access, security, encryption, use, and transmission of data (including any personally-identifiable data), and 3) backup and recovery of any database and any stored data. Licensee will not send or provide IBM access to any personally-identifiable information, whether in data or any other form, and will be responsible for reasonable costs and other amounts that IBM may incur relating to any such information mistakenly provided to IBM or the loss or disclosure of such information by IBM, including those arising out of any third party claims.&#xA;&#xA;8. Limitation of Liability&#xA;&#xA;The limitations and exclusions in this Section 8 (Limitation of Liability) apply to the full extent they are not prohibited by applicable law without the possibility of contractual waiver.&#xA;&#xA;8.1 Items for Which IBM May Be Liable&#xA;&#xA;Circumstances may arise where, because of a default on IBM&apos;s part or other liability, Licensee is entitled to recover damages from IBM. Regardless of the basis on which Licensee is entitled to claim damages from IBM (including fundamental breach, negligence, misrepresentation, or other contract or tort claim), IBM&apos;s entire liability for all claims in the aggregate arising from or related to each Program or otherwise arising under this Agreement will not exceed the amount of any 1) damages for bodily injury (including death) and damage to real property and tangible personal property and 2) other actual direct damages up to U.S. $10,000 (or equivalent in local currency).&#xA;&#xA;This limit also applies to any of IBM&apos;s Program developers and suppliers. It is the maximum for which IBM and its Program developers and suppliers are collectively responsible.&#xA;&#xA;8.2 Items for Which IBM Is Not Liable&#xA;&#xA;UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES IS IBM, ITS PROGRAM DEVELOPERS OR SUPPLIERS LIABLE FOR ANY OF THE FOLLOWING, EVEN IF INFORMED OF THEIR POSSIBILITY:&#xA;&#xA;a. LOSS OF, OR DAMAGE TO, DATA;&#xA;&#xA;b. SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, OR INDIRECT DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY ECONOMIC CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES; OR&#xA;&#xA;c. LOST PROFITS, BUSINESS, REVENUE, GOODWILL, OR ANTICIPATED SAVINGS.&#xA;&#xA;9. Compliance Verification&#xA;&#xA;For purposes of this Section 9 (Compliance Verification), &quot;Early Release Program Terms&quot; means 1) this Agreement and applicable amendments and transaction documents provided by IBM, and 2) IBM software policies that may be found at the IBM Software Policy website (www.ibm.com/softwarepolicies), including but not limited to those policies concerning backup, sub-capacity pricing, and migration.&#xA;&#xA;The rights and obligations set forth in this Section 9 remain in effect during the period the Program is licensed to Licensee, and for two years thereafter.&#xA;&#xA;9.1 Verification Process&#xA;&#xA;Licensee agrees to create, retain, and provide to IBM and its auditors accurate written records, system tool outputs, and other system information sufficient to provide auditable verification that Licensee&apos;s use of all Programs is in compliance with the Early Release Program Terms, including, without limitation, all of IBM&apos;s applicable licensing and pricing qualification terms. Licensee is responsible for 1) ensuring that it does not exceed its Authorized Use, and 2) remaining in compliance with Early Release Program Terms.&#xA;&#xA;Upon reasonable notice, IBM may verify Licensee&apos;s compliance with Early Release Program Terms at all sites and for all environments in which Licensee uses (for any purpose) Programs subject to Early Release Program Terms. Such verification will be conducted in a manner that minimizes disruption to Licensee&apos;s business, and may be conducted on Licensee&apos;s premises, during normal business hours. IBM may use an independent auditor to assist with such verification, provided IBM has a written confidentiality agreement in place with such auditor.&#xA;&#xA;9.2 Resolution&#xA;&#xA;IBM will notify Licensee in writing if any such verification indicates that Licensee has used any Program in excess of its Authorized Use or is otherwise not in compliance with the Early Release Program Terms. Licensee agrees to promptly pay directly to IBM the charges that IBM specifies in an invoice for 1) any such excess use, 2) support for such excess use for the lesser of the duration of such excess use or two years, and 3) any additional charges and other liabilities determined as a result of such verification.&#xA;&#xA;10. Third Party Notices&#xA;&#xA;The Program may include third party code that IBM, not the third party, licenses to Licensee under this Agreement. Notices, if any, for the third party code (&quot;Third Party Notices&quot;) are included for Licensee&apos;s information only. These notices can be found in the Program&apos;s NOTICES file(s). Information on how to obtain source code for certain third party code can be found in the Third Party Notices. If in the Third Party Notices IBM identifies third party code as &quot;Modifiable Third Party Code,&quot; IBM authorizes Licensee to 1) modify the Modifiable Third Party Code and 2) reverse engineer the Program modules that directly interface with the Modifiable Third Party Code provided that it is only for the purpose of debugging Licensee&apos;s modifications to such third party code. IBM&apos;s service and support obligations, if any, apply only to the unmodified Program.&#xA;&#xA;11. General&#xA;&#xA;a. Nothing in this Agreement affects any statutory rights of consumers that cannot be waived or limited by contract.&#xA;&#xA;b. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of this Agreement remain in full force and effect.&#xA;&#xA;c. Licensee is prohibited from exporting the Program.&#xA;&#xA;d. Licensee authorizes International Business Machines Corporation and its subsidiaries (and their successors and assigns, contractors and IBM Business Partners) to store and use Licensee&apos;s business contact information wherever they do business, in connection with IBM products and services, or in furtherance of IBM&apos;s business relationship with Licensee.&#xA;&#xA;e. Each party will allow the other reasonable opportunity to comply before it claims that the other has not met its obligations under this Agreement. The parties will attempt in good faith to resolve all disputes, disagreements, or claims between the parties relating to this Agreement.&#xA;&#xA;f.

No Warranties&#xA;&#xA;The following paragraph is added to the second paragraph of this Section 5 (No Warranties):&#xA;&#xA;Except as expressly provided in these terms and conditions, or Section 12 of the Sale of Goods Act 1893 as amended by the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980 (the &quot;1980 Act&quot;), all conditions or warranties (express or implied, statutory or otherwise) are hereby excluded including, without limitation, any warranties implied by the Sale of Goods Act 1893 as amended by the 1980 Act (including, for the avoidance of doubt, Section 39 of the 1980 Act).&#xA;&#xA;IRELAND AND UNITED KINGDOM&#xA;&#xA;2. Agreement Structure&#xA;&#xA;The following sentence is added:&#xA;&#xA;Nothing in this paragraph shall have the effect of excluding or limiting liability for fraud.&#xA;&#xA;8.1 Items for Which IBM May Be Liable&#xA;&#xA;The following replaces the first paragraph of the Subsection:&#xA;&#xA;For the purposes of this section, a &quot;Default&quot; means any act, statement, omission or negligence on the part of IBM in connection with, or in relation to, the subject matter of an Agreement in respect of which IBM is legally liable to Licensee, whether in contract or in tort. A number of Defaults which together result in, or contribute to, substantially the same loss or damage will be treated as one Default.&#xA;&#xA;Circumstances may arise where, because of a Default by IBM in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement or other liability, Licensee is entitled to recover damages from IBM. Regardless of the basis on which Licensee is entitled to claim damages from IBM and except as expressly required by law without the possibility of contractual waiver, IBM&apos;s entire liability for any one Default will not exceed the amount of any direct damages, to the extent actually suffered by Licensee as an immediate and direct consequence of the Default, up to 500,000 euro (or the equivalent in local currency) for the Program that is the subject of the claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the amount of any damages for bodily injury (including death) and damage to real property and tangible personal property for which IBM is legally liable is not subject to such limitation.&#xA;&#xA;8.2 Items for Which IBM Is Not Liable&#xA;&#xA;The following replaces Items 8.2b and 8.2c:&#xA;&#xA;b. special, incidental, exemplary, or indirect damages or consequential damages; or&#xA;&#xA;c. wasted management time or lost profits, business, revenue, goodwill, or anticipated savings.&#xA;&#xA;Z125-5544-05 (07/2011)&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;LICENSE INFORMATION&#xA;&#xA;The Programs listed below are licensed under the following terms and conditions in addition to those of the IBM International License Agreement for Early Release of Programs (IBM form number Z125-5544-05).&#xA;&#xA;Program Name: WebSphere Application Server Developer Tools for Eclipse Beta&#xA;Program Number: Early Release&#xA;&#xA;Test Period&#xA;&#xA;The test period begins on the date that Licensee agrees to the terms of this Agreement and ends after 90 days.&#xA;&#xA;L/N:  L-SWIS-9GXQRV&#xA;D/N:  L-SWIS-9GXQRV&#xA;P/N:  L-SWIS-9GXQRV '/>

Licensee does not 1) use the Program for productive purposes or otherwise use, copy, modify, or distribute the Program except as expressly permitted in this Agreement; 2) reverse assemble, reverse compile, otherwise translate, or reverse engineer the Program, except as expressly permitted by law without the possibility of contractual waiver; 3) use any of the Program&apos;s components, files, modules, audio-visual content, or related licensed materials separately from that Program; 4) sublicense, rent, or lease the Program; or 5) use the Program for commercial application hosting; and&#xA;&#xA;f. if Licensee obtains this Program as a Supporting Program, Licensee uses this Program only to support the Principal Program and subject to any limitations in the license to the Principal Program, or, if Licensee obtains this Program as a Principal Program, Licensee uses all Supporting Programs only to support this Program, and subject to any limitations in this Agreement. For purposes of this Item &quot;f,&quot; a &quot;Supporting Program&quot; is a Program that is part of another IBM Program (&quot;Principal Program&quot;) and identified as a Supporting Program in the Principal Program&apos;s LI. (To obtain a separate license to a Supporting Program without these restrictions, Licensee should contact the party from whom Licensee obtained the Supporting Program.)&#xA;&#xA;This license applies to each copy of the Program that Licensee makes.&#xA;&#xA;3.1 Updates, Fixes, and Patches&#xA;&#xA;When Licensee receives an update, fix, or patch to a Program, Licensee accepts any additional or different terms that are applicable to such update, fix, or patch that are specified in its LI. If no additional or different terms are provided, then the update, fix, or patch is subject solely to this Agreement. If the Program is replaced by an update, Licensee agrees to promptly discontinue use of the replaced Program.&#xA;&#xA;3.2 Term and Termination&#xA;&#xA;The Test Period begins on the date Licensee agrees to the terms of this Agreement and ends upon the earliest of 1) the end of the duration or the date specified by IBM in either the License Information or a transaction document, 2) the date on which the Program automatically disables itself, or 3) the date on which IBM makes the Program commercially available. Licensee&apos;s license to the Program terminates at the end of the Test Period, and Licensee agrees to promptly discontinue use of the Program and destroy all of Licensee&apos;s copies of the Program within 10 days of the end of the Test Period.&#xA;&#xA;IBM may terminate Licensee&apos;s license if Licensee fails to comply with the terms of this Agreement. If the license is terminated for any reason by either party, Licensee agrees to promptly discontinue use of and destroy all of Licensee&apos;s copies of the Program.&#xA;&#xA;THE PROGRAM MAY CONTAIN A DISABLING DEVICE THAT WILL PREVENT IT FROM BEING USED AFTER THE TEST PERIOD ENDS. LICENSEE AGREES NOT TO TAMPER WITH THE DISABLING DEVICE OR THE PROGRAM. LICENSEE SHOULD TAKE PRECAUTIONS TO AVOID ANY LOSS OF DATA THAT MIGHT RESULT WHEN THE PROGRAM CAN NO LONGER BE USED.&#xA;&#xA;4. Charges&#xA;&#xA;There is no charge for the use of the Program for the duration of the Test Period.&#xA;&#xA;5. Rights in Data&#xA;&#xA;Licensee assigns to IBM all right, title, and interest (including ownership of copyright) in any data, suggestions, or written materials that 1) are related to the Program and 2) Licensee provides to IBM. Upon IBM&apos;s request, Licensee will sign additional documents necessary to assign such rights. In addition to the foregoing, Licensee grants to IBM a non-exclusive, irrevocable, unrestricted, worldwide and paid-up right and license to a) include in any product or service any idea, know-how, concept, technique, invention, discovery or improvement, whether or not patentable, that Licensee provides to IBM related to the Program b) use, manufacture and market any such product or service, and c) allow others to do any of the foregoing.&#xA;&#xA;6. No Warranties&#xA;&#xA;SUBJECT TO ANY STATUTORY WARRANTIES THAT CANNOT BE EXCLUDED, IBM MAKES NO WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, REGARDING THE PROGRAM OR SUPPORT, IF ANY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND TITLE, AND ANY WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF NON-INFRINGEMENT.&#xA;&#xA;SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO LICENSEE. IN THAT EVENT, SUCH WARRANTIES ARE LIMITED IN DURATION TO THE MINIMUM PERIOD REQUIRED BY LAW. NO WARRANTIES APPLY AFTER THAT PERIOD. SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO LICENSEE. LICENSEE MAY HAVE OTHER RIGHTS THAT VARY FROM STATE TO STATE OR JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION.&#xA;&#xA;THE DISCLAIMERS AND EXCLUSIONS IN THIS SECTION 6 ALSO APPLY TO ANY OF IBM&apos;S PROGRAM DEVELOPERS AND SUPPLIERS.&#xA;&#xA;MANUFACTURERS, SUPPLIERS, OR PUBLISHERS OF NON-IBM PROGRAMS MAY PROVIDE THEIR OWN WARRANTIES.&#xA;&#xA;IBM DOES NOT PROVIDE SUPPORT OF ANY KIND, UNLESS IBM SPECIFIES OTHERWISE. IN SUCH EVENT, ANY SUPPORT PROVIDED BY IBM IS SUBJECT TO THE DISCLAIMERS AND EXCLUSIONS IN THIS SECTION 6.&#xA;&#xA;7. Licensee Data and Databases&#xA;&#xA;To assist Licensee in isolating the cause of a problem with the Program, IBM may request that Licensee 1) allow IBM to remotely access Licensee&apos;s system or 2) send Licensee information or system data to IBM. However, IBM is not obligated to provide such assistance unless IBM and Licensee enter a separate written agreement under which IBM agrees to provide to Licensee that type of support, which is beyond IBM&apos;s obligations in this Agreement. In any event, IBM uses information about errors and problems to improve its products and services, and assist with its provision of related support offerings. For these purposes, IBM may use IBM entities and subcontractors (including in one or more countries other than the one in which Licensee is located), and Licensee authorizes IBM to do so.&#xA;&#xA;Licensee remains responsible for 1) any data and the content of any database Licensee makes available to IBM, 2) the selection and implementation of procedures and controls regarding access, security, encryption, use, and transmission of data (including any personally-identifiable data), and 3) backup and recovery of any database and any stored data. Licensee will not send or provide IBM access to any personally-identifiable information, whether in data or any other form, and will be responsible for reasonable costs and other amounts that IBM may incur relating to any such information mistakenly provided to IBM or the loss or disclosure of such information by IBM, including those arising out of any third party claims.&#xA;&#xA;8. Limitation of Liability&#xA;&#xA;The limitations and exclusions in this Section 8 (Limitation of Liability) apply to the full extent they are not prohibited by applicable law without the possibility of contractual waiver.&#xA;&#xA;8.1 Items for Which IBM May Be Liable&#xA;&#xA;Circumstances may arise where, because of a default on IBM&apos;s part or other liability, Licensee is entitled to recover damages from IBM. Regardless of the basis on which Licensee is entitled to claim damages from IBM (including fundamental breach, negligence, misrepresentation, or other contract or tort claim), IBM&apos;s entire liability for all claims in the aggregate arising from or related to each Program or otherwise arising under this Agreement will not exceed the amount of any 1) damages for bodily injury (including death) and damage to real property and tangible personal property and 2) other actual direct damages up to U.S. $10,000 (or equivalent in local currency).&#xA;&#xA;This limit also applies to any of IBM&apos;s Program developers and suppliers. It is the maximum for which IBM and its Program developers and suppliers are collectively responsible.&#xA;&#xA;8.2 Items for Which IBM Is Not Liable&#xA;&#xA;UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES IS IBM, ITS PROGRAM DEVELOPERS OR SUPPLIERS LIABLE FOR ANY OF THE FOLLOWING, EVEN IF INFORMED OF THEIR POSSIBILITY:&#xA;&#xA;a. LOSS OF, OR DAMAGE TO, DATA;&#xA;&#xA;b. SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, OR INDIRECT DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY ECONOMIC CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES; OR&#xA;&#xA;c. LOST PROFITS, BUSINESS, REVENUE, GOODWILL, OR ANTICIPATED SAVINGS.&#xA;&#xA;9. Compliance Verification&#xA;&#xA;For purposes of this Section 9 (Compliance Verification), &quot;Early Release Program Terms&quot; means 1) this Agreement and applicable amendments and transaction documents provided by IBM, and 2) IBM software policies that may be found at the IBM Software Policy website (www.ibm.com/softwarepolicies), including but not limited to those policies concerning backup, sub-capacity pricing, and migration.&#xA;&#xA;The rights and obligations set forth in this Section 9 remain in effect during the period the Program is licensed to Licensee, and for two years thereafter.&#xA;&#xA;9.1 Verification Process&#xA;&#xA;Licensee agrees to create, retain, and provide to IBM and its auditors accurate written records, system tool outputs, and other system information sufficient to provide auditable verification that Licensee&apos;s use of all Programs is in compliance with the Early Release Program Terms, including, without limitation, all of IBM&apos;s applicable licensing and pricing qualification terms. Licensee is responsible for 1) ensuring that it does not exceed its Authorized Use, and 2) remaining in compliance with Early Release Program Terms.&#xA;&#xA;Upon reasonable notice, IBM may verify Licensee&apos;s compliance with Early Release Program Terms at all sites and for all environments in which Licensee uses (for any purpose) Programs subject to Early Release Program Terms. Such verification will be conducted in a manner that minimizes disruption to Licensee&apos;s business, and may be conducted on Licensee&apos;s premises, during normal business hours. IBM may use an independent auditor to assist with such verification, provided IBM has a written confidentiality agreement in place with such auditor.&#xA;&#xA;9.2 Resolution&#xA;&#xA;IBM will notify Licensee in writing if any such verification indicates that Licensee has used any Program in excess of its Authorized Use or is otherwise not in compliance with the Early Release Program Terms. Licensee agrees to promptly pay directly to IBM the charges that IBM specifies in an invoice for 1) any such excess use, 2) support for such excess use for the lesser of the duration of such excess use or two years, and 3) any additional charges and other liabilities determined as a result of such verification.&#xA;&#xA;10. Third Party Notices&#xA;&#xA;The Program may include third party code that IBM, not the third party, licenses to Licensee under this Agreement. Notices, if any, for the third party code (&quot;Third Party Notices&quot;) are included for Licensee&apos;s information only. These notices can be found in the Program&apos;s NOTICES file(s). Information on how to obtain source code for certain third party code can be found in the Third Party Notices. If in the Third Party Notices IBM identifies third party code as &quot;Modifiable Third Party Code,&quot; IBM authorizes Licensee to 1) modify the Modifiable Third Party Code and 2) reverse engineer the Program modules that directly interface with the Modifiable Third Party Code provided that it is only for the purpose of debugging Licensee&apos;s modifications to such third party code. IBM&apos;s service and support obligations, if any, apply only to the unmodified Program.&#xA;&#xA;11. General&#xA;&#xA;a. Nothing in this Agreement affects any statutory rights of consumers that cannot be waived or limited by contract.&#xA;&#xA;b. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of this Agreement remain in full force and effect.&#xA;&#xA;c. Licensee is prohibited from exporting the Program.&#xA;&#xA;d. Licensee authorizes International Business Machines Corporation and its subsidiaries (and their successors and assigns, contractors and IBM Business Partners) to store and use Licensee&apos;s business contact information wherever they do business, in connection with IBM products and services, or in furtherance of IBM&apos;s business relationship with Licensee.&#xA;&#xA;e. Each party will allow the other reasonable opportunity to comply before it claims that the other has not met its obligations under this Agreement. The parties will attempt in good faith to resolve all disputes, disagreements, or claims between the parties relating to this Agreement.&#xA;&#xA;f. Unless otherwise required by applicable law without the possibility of contractual waiver or limitation: 1) neither party will bring a legal action, regardless of form, for any claim arising out of or related to this Agreement more than two years after the cause of action arose; and 2) upon the expiration of such time limit, any such claim and all respective rights related to the claim lapse.&#xA;&#xA;g. Neither Licensee nor IBM is responsible for failure to fulfill any obligations due to causes beyond its control.&#xA;&#xA;h. No right or cause of action for any third party is created by this Agreement, nor is IBM responsible for any third party claims against Licensee, except as permitted in Subsection 8.1 (Items for Which IBM May Be Liable) above for bodily injury (including death) or damage to real or tangible personal property for which IBM is legally liable to that third party.&#xA;&#xA;i. In entering into this Agreement, neither party is relying on any representation not specified in this Agreement, including but not limited to any representation concerning: 1) the performance or function of the Program, other than as expressly warranted in Section 6 (No Warranties) above; 2) the experiences or recommendations of other parties; or 3) any results or savings that Licensee may achieve.&#xA;&#xA;j. IBM has signed agreements with certain organizations (called &quot;IBM Business Partners&quot;) to promote, market, and support certain Programs. IBM Business Partners remain independent and separate from IBM. IBM is not responsible for the actions or statements of IBM Business Partners or obligations they have to Licensee.&#xA;&#xA;k. The license and intellectual property indemnification terms of Licensee&apos;s other agreements with IBM (such as the IBM Customer Agreement) do not apply to Program licenses granted under this Agreement.&#xA;&#xA;l. IBM does not warrant that any version of the Program that is formally released or made commercially available (if any) will be similar to, or compatible with, Early Release versions.&#xA;&#xA;m. Licensee may not assign this Agreement, in whole or in part, without IBM&apos;s prior written consent. Any attempt to do so is void.&#xA;&#xA;n. Any terms of this Agreement that by their nature extend beyond termination of this Agreement remain in effect until fulfilled, and apply to both parties&apos; respective successors and assignees.&#xA;&#xA;o. Both parties agree that all information exchanged is nonconfidential. If either party requires the exchange of confidential information, it will be made under a signed confidentiality agreement.&#xA;&#xA;12. Geographic Scope and Governing Law&#xA;&#xA;12.1 Governing Law&#xA;&#xA;Both parties agree to the application of the laws of the country in which Licensee obtained the Program license to govern, interpret, and enforce all of Licensee&apos;s and IBM&apos;s respective rights, duties, and obligations arising from, or relating in any manner to, the subject matter of this Agreement, without regard to conflict of law principles.&#xA;&#xA;The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply.&#xA;&#xA;12.2 Jurisdiction&#xA;&#xA;All rights, duties, and obligations are subject to the courts of the country in which Licensee obtained the Program license.&#xA;&#xA;Part 2 - Country-unique Terms&#xA;&#xA;For licenses granted in the countries specified below, the following terms replace or modify the referenced terms in Part 1.

The arbitration award will be final and binding for the parties without appeal and will be in writing and set forth the findings of fact and the conclusions of law.&#xA;&#xA;The number of arbitrators will be three, with each side to the dispute being entitled to appoint one arbitrator. The two arbitrators appointed by the parties will appoint a third arbitrator who will act as chairman of the proceedings. Vacancies in the post of chairman will be filled by the president of the SIAC. Other vacancies will be filled by the respective nominating party.

The arbitration will take place in Beijing and be conducted in Chinese. The arbitration award will be final and binding on both parties. During the course of arbitration, this agreement will continue to be performed except for the part which the parties are disputing and which is undergoing arbitration.&#xA;&#xA;(3) In Indonesia:&#xA;&#xA;Each party will allow the other reasonable opportunity to comply before it claims that the other has not met its obligations under this Agreement. The parties will attempt in good faith to resolve all disputes, disagreements, or claims between the parties relating to this Agreement.
